## v8.31.0 — 2026-04-29 — Fix Turkish structure parsing, RPE priority, RACE_DAY format

parseStructure in RaceGoalDashCard + TrainingBridgeCard: added Turkish keyword support
  — WU|Isınma, MAIN|ANA, CD|Soğuma (case-insensitive, handles ısınma/soğuma lowercase).
  Previously all Turkish quality sessions (tempo, intervals, race sim) fell through
  to raw text; now correctly renders WU/MAIN/CD blocks for TR locale users.
parseAdaptation in RaceGoalDashCard: added TR Science|Bilim, Stimulus|Uyarı, AMAÇ
  keywords — science notes were silently dropped for all Turkish structure texts.
RPE display priority fixed in RaceGoalDashCard: run.rpeLow/rpeHigh (session-specific
  from sessionLibrary) now takes precedence over zoneInfo.rpeRange (generic zone range
  from paceZoneTranslator). E.g. tempo rpeLow=7 vs generic zone-4 rpeRange=6–7.
sessionLibrary RACE_DAY structure: changed WU:/Isınma: (colon) to WU /Isınma (space)
  to match all other session formats, and restructured as WU … MAIN: … so the full
  pacing strategy is captured in the parsed MAIN block rather than being lost.
249 test files, 4479 tests — all pass.
DEPENDS ON: v8.28.0, v8.30.0

## v8.30.0 — 2026-04-29 — Race goal card fixes: runColor, zoneKey, log shortcut, typos

RaceGoalDashCard.jsx:
  runColor bug fixed — RACE DAY (zone 5, type string no-match) was getting blue
    (#0064ff) because zoneInfo.color from translateAllZones overrode the correct
    orange. Now uses zoneColor(runZone) directly; zoneInfo kept only for feel/RPE
    fallback text.
  zoneKey fixed — now checks run.zone number first (5→I, 4→T, 3→M) before
    falling back to type-string regex. Eliminates all zone-number/color mismatches.
  onLogSession prop added — "+ LOG THIS SESSION" / "+ ANTRENMAN KAYDET" button
    appears when a run prescription is visible and prop is provided.
Dashboard.jsx: onLogSession forwarded to RaceGoalDashCard at both render sites.
RaceGoalAnalyzerCard.jsx: fixed 'MESAFe' → 'MESAFE' and
  'FİZYOLOJİK PARAMETRELer' → 'FİZYOLOJİK PARAMETRELER'.
249 test files, 4479 tests — all pass.
DEPENDS ON: v8.28.0, v8.29.0

## v8.29.0 — 2026-04-29 — TrainingBridgeCard upgraded to full multi-modal week grid

TrainingBridgeCard.jsx (E88 v2): complete upgrade to use rich sessionLibrary data.
  Day rows now show colored modality indicators: run (zone-color circle), strength
    (brown square), drills (blue triangle), preventive (green hollow circle).
  Per-day totalDurationMin shown right-aligned.
  Tappable expand: DayDetail sub-component renders full multi-modal prescription —
    run section with WU/MAIN/CD structure, pace/HR/RPE metrics panel;
    drills exercise list with distance/reps; strength exercise table with coaching
    notes and sets×reps; preventive exercise table with protocol notes.
  todayDow bug fixed: (getUTCDay()+6)%7 — same Mon-first fix as RaceGoalDashCard.
  Removed paceZoneTranslator dependency; all paces now from sess.run.paceStr.
4479 tests — all pass.
DEPENDS ON: sessionLibrary.js (E90), trainingBridge.js (E82)

## v8.28.0 — 2026-04-29 — Olympic coach daily training card redesign

RaceGoalDashCard.jsx (E87 v2): complete visual redesign with professional Olympic-coach hierarchy.
  Zone colour system: Z1=#555 (rec), Z2=#0064ff (easy), Z3=#5bc25b (marathon),
    Z4=#f5c542 (threshold), Z5=#ff6600 (VO₂max) — left border on run section.
  Phase header bar: PHASE · W{n}/{total} | VDOT badge | goal time + distance.
  Readiness strip: CTL | TSB (color-coded) | ACWR | NORMAL/TIRED/VERY TIRED label.
  Date + total duration header with TSB fatigue warning inline.
  TSB downgrade warning box (amber) when TSB < −20; session auto-adapted to easy.
  Run section: session title, zone badge, TSS; pace/HR/RPE metrics panel;
    WU/MAIN/CD structured prescription rows parsed from structure text;
    feel quote italic; science/adaptation note in zone-tinted background.
  Drills section: level badge, exercise list with distance/reps right-aligned.
  Strength section: category badge, exercise table with coaching notes, sets×reps.
  Preventive section: focus badge, exercise table with protocol notes.
  Weekly TSS progress bar (4px, color-coded by completion ratio).
  No-plan CTA when VDOT detected but no goal set.
  Bottom tag: SPOREUS COACHING SYSTEM + VDOT {current} → {goal} · {weeks}w.
  Bug fixed: todayDow uses (getUTCDay() + 6) % 7 for correct Mon-first indexing.
  Typos fixed: KOŞU ANTRENMANI, KORUYUCU ÇALIŞMALAR.
249 test files, 4479 tests — all pass.
DEPENDS ON: sessionLibrary.js (E90), trainingBridge.js (E82), paceZoneTranslator.js, intelligence.js

## v8.27.0 — 2026-04-29 — Full training prescription library: running + strength + drills + preventive

sessionLibrary.js (E90): complete 7-day multi-modal training plan builder.
  3 progressive drill circuits (beginner → intermediate → advanced).
  3 preventive routines (hip/glute activation, calf/Achilles care, full mobility).
  6 strength workout templates (foundation → progressive → maintenance) spanning
    20 exercises including Nordic hamstring curls, Bulgarian split squats,
    Copenhagen planks, eccentric calf raises (Alfredson protocol), plyometrics.
  16 running session templates with full bilingual structure prescriptions, pace
    placeholders injected from VDOT at build time, HR ranges from maxHR.
  buildFullWeekPlan(phase, vdot, weekInPhase, maxHR) returns 7-day DayPlan objects
    with backward-compat top-level fields preserved.
trainingBridge.js: replaced inline PHASE_SESSIONS with buildFullWeekPlan call;
  maxHR now extracted from goalAnalysis.predicted.maxHR and passed through.
RaceGoalDashCard.jsx: today's session block now shows full prescription text,
  drills strip, strength strip, preventive strip, total training time.
sessionLibrary.test.js: 47 new tests (249 files, 4479 total — all pass).

DEPENDS ON: raceGoalEngine.js (E80), trainingBridge.js (E82), sport/running.js

## v8.26.0 — 2026-04-29 — Fix date-anchored HRV suppression test; remove dead templateExercises prop

hrvSummary.test.js: computeHRVTrend uses new Date() for its 7-day window — test
  broke as system date advanced past the test data's last entry (2026-04-22 + 7d).
  Fixed with vi.useFakeTimers({ now: '2026-04-22' }) in try/finally so clock is
  always restored and test is date-independent going forward.
ProgramView.jsx: removed unused templateExercises = [] from destructuring — prop
  was declared but never read (exercises prop does the name lookup at line 56).
GeneralFitness.jsx: removed corresponding templateExercises={SEED_EXERCISES} pass-through.
248 test files, 4432 tests total.
DEPENDS ON: v8.25.0

---

## v8.25.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: ReportsTab exact length; AuthGate form-submission coverage

ReportsTab.test.jsx: two loose toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(2) changed to toHaveLength(2)
  — confirmed exactly 2 matches (generate card + history group header).
AuthGate.test.jsx: added SIGN IN form-submission test (signInWithPassword called with
  email+password), MAGIC mode form-submission test (signInWithOtp called with email).
  Used fireEvent.submit on form element to avoid SIGN IN tab/button text ambiguity.
  (6 → 8 tests)
248 test files, 4432 tests total (+2 tests vs v8.24.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.24.0

---

## v8.24.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: TrainingLog delete-confirm + CAL toggle; SportProgramBuilder step navigation

TrainingLog.test.jsx: added 6 tests — empty-state 'No sessions logged yet.' message,
  delete ✕ shows confirm row, ← Cancel hides confirm without calling setLog,
  Delete → calls setLog filtered, LIST/CAL buttons present, ⊞ CAL hides table.
  (3 → 9 tests)
SportProgramBuilder.test.jsx: added 5 interaction tests — NEXT disabled before
  sport selected, NEXT disabled after sport only (no goal), NEXT enabled after
  sport+goal, NEXT advances to step 2 (spb_step2Title visible), Back returns to
  step 1. (18 → 23 tests)
248 test files, 4430 tests total (+11 tests vs v8.23.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.23.0

---

## v8.23.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: fix two misleading assertions in TrainingLog + CoachOnboardingWizard

TrainingLog.test.jsx: replaced `document.body.not.toBeEmptyDOMElement()` (passes for
  any render) with `screen.getByText(/SESSION HISTORY/)` — actually catches a blank render.
CoachOnboardingWizard.test.jsx: test 2 was named 'already onboarded' but passed open={false},
  making it identical to test 3 (component only gates on open prop, not localStorage). Replaced
  with 'renders when open=true even if flag set' — catches regression where component
  mistakenly gates on localStorage instead of deferring to parent.
No count change — same test count, stronger semantics.
248 test files, 4419 tests total.
DEPENDS ON: v8.22.0

---

## v8.22.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: fix misleading SessionHistory expand tests + add delete/expand coverage

SessionHistory.test.jsx: two tests labelled "expanded detail" were checking text
  visible in the collapsed subtitle (always passing). Fixed to use fireEvent.click on
  the session date row and assert exercise name appears only after expansion.
Added: expand shows weighted top-set kg×reps, delete ✕ → confirm/cancel UI flow,
  confirm calls onDelete with session id, cancel restores ✕ button, LOG NEW → callback.
10 → 14 tests; all prior passing — no regressions.
248 test files, 4419 tests total (+4 tests vs v8.21.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.21.0

---

## v8.21.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: complete GF track test coverage (70 new tests, 3 files)

GeneralDashboard.test.jsx (NEW, 24 tests): gap-line variants, PR celebration+dismiss,
  deload/coach-confirmed/milestone badges, week progress + cycle-complete, recent sessions,
  first-session prompt, onLogSession callback, TR locale.
GeneralOnboarding.test.jsx (NEW, 19 tests): 3-step GF wizard goal/experience/equipment,
  Next gating, Back navigation, suggested template name, handleFinish shape,
  anti-overcommitment guard (beginner+5days → 3), no guardrail for intermediate.
GFSmallComponents.test.jsx (NEW, 29 tests): ProgramTemplateGallery, ProgramView,
  ProgressionChart (SVG polyline, BW MAX REPS header), WeeklyVolumeChart (10 muscle labels),
  GeneralInsights (empty state, 2+ sessions progression, 1-session message).
All GF track components now have test coverage.
248 test files, 4415 tests total (+3 files, +70 tests vs v8.20.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.20.0

---

## v8.20.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: SessionLogger 17-test suite (largest untested GF component)

src/components/__tests__/SessionLogger.test.jsx (NEW): 17 tests covering:
  empty-state renders, LOG SESSION/ANTRENMAN KAYDI heading, FINISH SESSION button
  gating (disabled until reps entered), onSave session shape for BW exercise
  (load_kg → null), set filtering (only filled sets saved), duration_minutes and
  rpe passed through, localStorage draft cleared after save, draft restored banner
  for matching dayKey, banner absent for wrong day or expired draft (>24h TTL),
  v8.16.0 regression guard (auto-save when only dayLabel or durationMin set, no rows).
245 test files, 4343 tests total (+1 file, +17 tests vs v8.19.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.19.0

---

## v8.19.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: strengthen 3 weak assertions across 244-file audit

TodayView.test.jsx: replaced trivially-true `textContent.length > 0` with
  `getByText("HOW DO YOU FEEL TODAY?")` and added "TODAY'S READINESS" heading test.
ErrorBoundary.test.jsx: replaced redundant `getAllByText().length > 0` (getAllByText
  already throws when empty) with `getByText().toBeInTheDocument()`.
sessionAnalysis.test.js: replaced `zone_estimate.length > 0` with `/^Zone/` regex —
  catches accidental empty or 'Unknown' return for valid RPE inputs.
Complete audit of all 244 test files complete; no other structural weaknesses found.
244 test files, 4326 tests total (+1 test vs v8.18.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.18.0

---

## v8.18.0 — 2026-04-28 — Tests: +19 covering v8.16/v8.17 fixes + duplicate key warning

ScienceTooltip.jsx: removed duplicate whiteSpace key in tooltip style object
  (whiteSpace:'nowrap' immediately overridden by whiteSpace:'normal' on next line).
  Vite emitted a build warning on every dev-server start; now clean.
src/components/__tests__/SessionHistory.test.jsx (NEW): 10 tests covering
  session display, duration_minutes subtitle, weekly stats bar, bilingual labels,
  and the BW topSet regression fixed in v8.17.0.
src/lib/__tests__/athlete/generalFitnessSync.test.js (NEW): 9 tests covering
  syncGeneralProgram no-ops, payload shape, last_workout_done_at gate,
  last_session_duration_minutes field (v8.16.0), and console.warn on Supabase error.
244 test files, 4325 tests total (+2 files, +19 tests vs v8.17.0).
DEPENDS ON: v8.17.0

---

## v8.17.0 — 2026-04-28 — SessionHistory BW reps bug + ConfirmModal in GF

SessionHistory.jsx: topSet reduce seeded with null — for bodyweight exercises
  (all load_kg === null) the reduce returned null, hiding rep counts entirely.
  Fixed by seeding with wSets[0] instead of null (no initial value); BW exercises
  now correctly surface the first set's reps in the expanded detail view.
GeneralFitness.jsx: replaced both window.confirm() calls (switch template,
  reset program) with the branded ConfirmModal component — consistent with
  TrainingLog and ReportsTab; bilingual title/body/buttons included.
DEPENDS ON: v8.16.0

---

## v8.16.0 — 2026-04-28 — Fix three GF data-flow gaps

generalFitnessSync.js: Supabase `.update()` error is now captured and
  console.warn'd instead of silently swallowed — fixes invisible coach-visibility
  failures that were impossible to diagnose in production.
generalFitnessSync.js: last_session_duration_minutes added to general_program
  JSONB payload so coach dashboard receives session duration after each save.
SessionLogger.jsx: draft auto-save guard expanded — previously bailed when
  rows.length === 0, losing duration/label/RPE/notes typed before adding
  any exercises. Now saves draft whenever any content field is non-empty.
GeneralFitness.jsx: last_session_duration_minutes threaded into sessionSummary
  passed to syncGeneralProgram after each session save.
DEPENDS ON: v8.15.0

---

## v8.15.0 — 2026-04-28 — Verification pass: data display, bilingual Recovery/App fixes

SessionHistory.jsx: duration_minutes now shown in session row subtitle (e.g. "3
  exercises · 12 work sets · 60 min · RPE 7"). Closes the data-capture-but-never-
  displayed gap introduced with the duration field in v8.14.0.
SessionHistory.jsx: removed redundant "none logged" span from weekly stats bar —
  "0 sessions" already communicates the state; greyed-out color applied instead.
SessionLogger.jsx: Math.max(0, ...) guard — anchors result to 0 so maxGap is
  never NaN or negative even if gapDays contains unexpected undefined entries.
App.jsx: sync status dot tooltip now bilingual (Çevrimdışı / Senkronize edildi /
  Senkronize ediliyor…). Search and AI semantic search button tooltips bilingual.
Recovery.jsx: 9 hardcoded English strings replaced with t() calls using 9 new
  LangCtx keys (recovSleepDetails, recovHrvBiometrics, recovHrvRmssd,
  recovRestingHr, recovHrvNote, recovHrv7day, recovAdvancedMetrics,
  recovBloodLactate, recovLactateBaseline). Also removed duplicate lang ternary
  in HRV note — now consistent with rest of Recovery's t() pattern.
i18n.test.js: recovHrvRmssd added to ALLOWED_IDENTICAL (technical acronym,
  same spelling in Turkish).
DEPENDS ON: v8.14.0

---

## v8.14.0 — 2026-04-28 — GF enhancements: duration, 2-stage delete, weekly stats

SessionLogger.jsx: added Duration (min) field — captures session duration alongside
  RPE; saved as duration_minutes in session object; included in draft save/restore.
SessionLogger.jsx: two-stage exercise delete — ✕ now shows del/keep buttons before
  removing; eliminates accidental loss of filled-in rows during active sessions.
SessionLogger.jsx: welcome-back safety banner — if gap > 14 days for any preloaded
  exercise, shows yellow ⚠ banner "N days since last session — start light today."
  Uses maxGap across all exercises in the day's prescription.
SessionHistory.jsx: weekly aggregate stats bar — always visible when sessions exist;
  shows session count, work sets, and unique exercise count for the current week
  (Mon–today). Computed from sorted sessions using same week-start logic as Insights.
ProgramView.jsx: rest days now visually distinct — dark background (#0d0d0d), faded
  border, 0.7 opacity, and label changed to uppercase "REST DAY" for clearer scanning.
TrainingLog.jsx: TSS band (░░░░) column now color-coded — grey <50, green 50-99,
  yellow 100-149, red 150+. Matches RPE color convention already used in log table.
  Added tssBandColor() helper function alongside existing tssBand().
DEPENDS ON: v8.13.0

---

## v8.13.0 — 2026-04-28 — Bilingual UI pass: Dashboard, TrainingLog, Profile

LangCtx.jsx: +26 new EN/TR keys covering dashboard coaching messages,
  monotony label, TrainingLog toolbar buttons + modal strings, Profile dialogs.
Dashboard.jsx: coachingMsg IIFE now uses t() for all 4 athlete-level strings.
  Edge-case TSB fallback message uses lang ternary. Monotony "⚠ INJURY RISK" /
  "Normal" label now bilingual via t().
TrainingLog.jsx: extracted lang from useContext(LangCtx) — removed duplicate
  useLocalStorage('sporeus-lang') declaration (and its unused import). All
  toolbar buttons, modal headers, AI insight panel, zone breakdown label,
  save/cancel buttons, and "no entries" message now use t().
Profile.jsx: confirm() and alert() dialogs (reset data, GDPR delete,
  import failed, sign-in required) now use t() — Turkish users see native text.
i18n.test.js: added monoNormal to ALLOWED_IDENTICAL ('Normal' is a Turkish
  loanword, identical spelling is correct).
DEPENDS ON: v8.12.0

---

## v8.12.0 — 2026-04-28 — Bilingual toasts + keyboard fixes

LangCtx.jsx: added 5 new translation keys (toastCoachConnected, toastSwUpdate,
  toastSwUpdateAction, toastFirstSession, toastStorageFull, toastRestDays) in
  both EN and TR blocks.
useAppState.js: all 4 hardcoded English toast messages now use LABELS[lang]
  — coach-connected, SW update, first-session unlock, and storage-full toasts
  are bilingual for Turkish users.
TodayView.jsx: "3 rest days — CTL decaying…" inline card translated via
  lang ternary (Turkish: "3 dinlenme günü — KTY günlük ~%2,3 düşüyor.").
QuickAddModal.jsx: duration (minutes) input `inputMode` changed from "decimal"
  to "numeric" — iOS decimal keypad was showing a decimal point for an integer
  field; whole-number keypad is correct for session duration.
DEPENDS ON: v8.11.0

---

## v8.11.0 — 2026-04-28 — Live clock, bilingual UI fixes
App.jsx: header clock now lives — useState + setInterval(30s) replaces the
  frozen `new Date()` snapshot. During a workout the displayed time was stuck
  at app-load time; now it updates every 30 seconds.
App.jsx: dateStr now uses lang-aware locale ('tr-TR' for Turkish, 'en-GB'
  for English) so Turkish users see "28 NİS 2026" instead of "28 APR 2026".
  timeStr uses explicit `hour12: false` instead of relying on 'tr-TR' side-
  effect for 24h format.
App.jsx: "Start here" first-session tab badge translated (Başla / Start here).
App.jsx: footer shortcuts hint fully bilingual
  (? = kısayollar · + = hızlı kayıt … / ? = shortcuts · + = quick log …).
ConnectionBanner.jsx: accepts lang prop; "RECONNECTING TO LIVE FEED…" now
  renders as "CANLIYA YENİDEN BAĞLANIYOR…" in Turkish.
DEPENDS ON: v8.10.1

## v8.10.1 — 2026-04-28 — NaN guard, ProgramView polish, Insights sort
SessionLogger.jsx: load_kg save now guards against non-numeric input —
  `!isNaN(parseFloat(s.load_kg))` check added. type=text allows typing
  anything; without the guard "abc" would silently write NaN to the session.
ProgramView.jsx: experience_level now displays translated label (Beginner /
  Başlangıç etc.) instead of raw English key even when lang=tr.
ProgramView.jsx: each exercise row now shows rest_seconds (e.g. "90s"),
  defaulting to 90 when not specified.
GeneralInsights.jsx: progressExercises now sorted by most-recently-logged
  session date before taking the top 4. Users who switched templates now see
  their current exercises in progression charts, not their oldest ones.
DEPENDS ON: v8.10.0

## v8.10.0 — 2026-04-28 — Locale auto-detect, mobile keyboard, offline-safe sync
App.jsx: navigator.language auto-detects Turkish on first visit — TR browser gets TR default
  without manual toggle; stored localStorage preference overrides on subsequent visits.
SessionLogger.jsx: reps + RIR inputs → inputMode="numeric" (integer keypad, no letters on
  mobile). load_kg changed from type=number/step=2.5 to type=text/inputMode="decimal" so iOS
  shows decimal keyboard instead of the number spinner — critical for typing 52.5 with one
  hand mid-workout. Session RPE also gets inputMode="numeric".
generalFitnessSync.js: added navigator.onLine guard — Supabase write skipped when offline;
  avoids queuing failed requests.
GeneralFitness.jsx: window.addEventListener('online') handler — when connectivity restores,
  re-pushes current activeProgram to Supabase so sessions logged while offline reach the
  coach dashboard without user action.
DEPENDS ON: v8.9.1

## v8.9.1 — 2026-04-28 — Bug fixes: rest timer null-crash, delete ID mismatch, label typo, NaN date
SessionLogger.jsx: rest timer decrement no longer crashes when user dismisses mid-countdown.
  `setRestTimer(t => t ? {...t, seconds: Math.max(0, t.seconds-1)} : null)` — if t is null
  (user hit ✕ while setTimeout was pending) the state stays null instead of setting {seconds:0}.
GeneralFitness.jsx: one-time mount migration ensures every session in localStorage has a stable
  id. Prevents the sorted-index vs unsorted-indexOf mismatch in handleDeleteSession that could
  delete the wrong session when a session had no id field (possible for externally-imported data).
ProgramTemplateGallery.jsx: EXP_LABEL advanced.en was 'İleri Seviye' (Turkish text in English
  key). Corrected to 'Advanced'.
strengthTraining.js: daysSinceLastSession returns null (not NaN) when lastSessionDate is an
  invalid date string. Added `if (isNaN(last)) return null` guard.
DEPENDS ON: v8.9.0

## v8.9.0 — 2026-04-28 — Draft auto-save + band equipment fix
SessionLogger.jsx: draft auto-save to localStorage (key `sporeus-gf-draft`). Every change to
  rows, dayLabel, rpe, or notes persists the session in progress. On reload/re-open the draft
  is restored if the dayKey (exercise IDs joined) matches and the draft is under 24h old. A
  blue "↩ Draft restored" banner auto-dismisses after 4s (or manual ✕). Draft is cleared on
  FINISH SESSION. Prevents all in-progress data loss from accidental refresh or tab close.
  readDraft() is a module-scope helper; auto-save useEffect skips when rows are empty or
  already saved. Re-init useEffect (day change) also checks for a matching draft first.
GeneralFitness.jsx: EQUIP_ALLOW map now includes 'band' for the 'home' key
  (was ['bw','db'], now ['bw','db','band']). Home templates (home_db_3day, home_db_4day)
  reference band_pull_apart and band_row (equipment:'band' in SEED_EXERCISES) — without this
  fix those exercises showed as raw IDs in the logger and were absent from the Add Exercise
  dropdown.
DEPENDS ON: v8.8.0

## v8.8.0 — 2026-04-28 — BW chart fix, duplicate data removal, exercise dropdown groups, UX polish
ProgressionChart.jsx: added `isBW` prop — BW exercises now show max-reps progression instead of
  0 kg flat line. Y-axis labels, tooltips, and header ("MAX REPS" vs "TOP SET PROGRESSION")
  all switch based on isBW.
GeneralInsights.jsx: getProgressData receives isBW flag; BW exercises select top set by reps
  instead of by load. Passes isBW to ProgressionChart.
GeneralDashboard.jsx: removed ~90 lines of hardcoded TEMPLATE_DAY_EXERCISES and
  TEMPLATE_DAY_LABELS_EN/TR — single source of truth divergence risk eliminated. Dashboard
  now derives next-session exercise names and day label from currentDay prop (TEMPLATE_PROGRAM_DATA)
  via SEED_EXERCISES lookup, exactly like the SessionLogger does.
  Week progress bar now wraps per cycle: displaySess = sessCount % totalSessions so cycle 2
  starts at 0/16 instead of showing 17/16.
GeneralFitness.jsx: passes currentDay prop to GeneralDashboard.
SessionHistory.jsx: sessions logged today show a green "TODAY" badge inline with the date.
SessionLogger.jsx: exercise "Add Exercise" dropdown now uses <optgroup> by movement pattern
  (Squat / Hinge-Hip / Push-Horiz / Push-Vert / Pull-Horiz / Pull-Vert / Isolation / Core)
  instead of a flat 38-item list. Patterns and labels defined as module-scope constants.
DEPENDS ON: v8.7.0

## v8.7.0 — 2026-04-28 — SessionLogger UX: suggested load pre-fill, auto rest timer, cleaned saves
SessionLogger.jsx: suggested load pre-filled into all set inputs on open — no more retyping
  the same number across 4 sets. buildRow() computes suggestNextLoad at init time and passes
  the result into emptyRow() which sets load_kg for every set (skips bodyweight exercises).
  useEffect re-init also calls buildRow so switching days re-applies fresh suggestions.
SessionLogger.jsx: tapping ✓ (mark set done) now auto-starts the rest timer for that exercise
  row (uses prescription rest_seconds or 90s default). Previously required a separate button
  click after marking done — now one tap completes the set and starts the clock.
SessionLogger.jsx: REST button shown for all exercises, not just prescribed ones (defaults 90s).
SessionLogger.jsx: zero-rep sets are filtered out on save — pre-loaded rows the user didn't
  fill in don't become ghost "0 reps" entries in history.
SessionLogger.jsx: FINISH SESSION button gated by hasFilledSets (at least one set with reps>0)
  instead of rows.length>0 — prevents saving blank template-preloaded sessions.
SessionLogger.jsx: renamed local `exercises` in handleSave to `exerciseEntries` to avoid
  shadowing the exercises prop.
GeneralInsights.jsx: weekStart now uses Monday (consistent with weeklyMuscleFrequency).
GeneralDashboard.jsx: RECENT sessions show exercise count and work-set count inline.
ProgramTemplateGallery.jsx: "✓ Selected" button is non-interactive (cursor:default) when
  already the active template.
GeneralFitness.jsx: EQUIP_ALLOW moved to module scope.
DEPENDS ON: v8.6.0

## v8.6.0 — 2026-04-28 — Template-switch counter reset, delete scoping fix, equipment filter
GeneralFitness.jsx handleSelectTemplate: adds window.confirm dialog before switching;
  on confirm resets sessions_completed=0, reference_date=today, last_session_date=null,
  next_day_index=0 — prevents "Week 3" appearing on a brand-new template selection.
  Syncs updated program to Supabase.
GeneralFitness.jsx handleDeleteSession: replace raw updated.length counter with count of
  sessions with session_date >= activeProgram.reference_date — deleting a session from
  a previous template no longer corrupts the current-template progress pointer.
  last_session_date derived from filtered set instead of all sessions.
GeneralFitness.jsx filteredExercises: equipment-aware exercise list for SessionLogger.
  bw templates → bw-only exercises; home templates → bw + db exercises;
  gym/bb → all 38 SEED_EXERCISES. Prevents barbell exercises appearing in bodyweight/home
  programs "Add Exercise" dropdown.
DEPENDS ON: v8.5.0

## v8.5.0 — 2026-04-28 — Session delete, week progress bar, reset confirmation
SessionHistory.jsx: per-session ✕ delete button with inline confirm/cancel — prevents
  accidental deletion. Click ✕ → shows confirm + cancel inline; confirm calls onDelete.
GeneralFitness.jsx: handleDeleteSession removes session by id, then recomputes rotation
  from scratch: next_day_index = updated.length % templateDayCount, sessions_completed =
  updated.length, last_session_date = latest remaining session. Syncs to Supabase.
  Reset ⚙ button now shows window.confirm before wiping program — session history preserved.
GeneralDashboard.jsx: WEEK X / Y progress bar (orange fill, session count / total shown)
  based on sessions_completed vs days_per_week × weeks. Hides when cycleJustDone.
  Cycle-complete banner fires when sessions_completed is an exact multiple of
  (days_per_week × weeks): "Program block complete. Starting next cycle."
DEPENDS ON: v8.4.0

## v8.4.0 — 2026-04-28 — Log tab history, program day highlight, UX fixes
SessionHistory.jsx (NEW): Log tab now shows full session history — expandable cards
  per session with date, day label, exercise count, work sets, top load per exercise
  (sets × kg × reps), warmup count, notes. "LOG NEW →" button opens overlay logger.
  Sessions sorted newest-first; expand/collapse by tap.
ProgramView.jsx: accepts `currentDayIndex` prop; active day gets orange border + "NEXT →"
  pill so athletes can see exactly where they are in the rotation at a glance.
GeneralFitness.jsx: Log tab swapped from duplicate SessionLogger to SessionHistory;
  ProgramView now receives `currentDayIndex={activeProgram?.next_day_index ?? 0}`.
GeneralDashboard.jsx: removed "Awaiting coach review…" badge — it showed for every
  standalone athlete without a coach, creating permanent false expectation. Green
  "confirmed by coach" badge still appears when coach has confirmed.
DEPENDS ON: v8.3.0

## v8.3.0 — 2026-04-28 — Coach-athlete session confirmation loop (all sports)
Migration 20260477: `profiles.last_workout_done_at` timestamptz (athlete marks done),
  `coach_athletes.coach_verified_at + coach_verified_note` (coach review timestamp),
  `coach_verify_athlete(athlete_id, note)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC validates active link.
generalFitnessSync.js: `syncGeneralProgram` now accepts sessionSummary (4th arg) and writes
  `last_session_label`, `last_session_exercise_count` into general_program JSONB + sets
  `last_workout_done_at` on the same profiles UPDATE call. Added `getEnduranceMembers(coachId)` —
  fetches non-GF athletes with last_workout_done_at + coach_verified_at via two-step join.
  Added `verifyAthlete(athleteId, note)` — calls RPC for both GF + endurance athletes.
GeneralFitness.jsx: handleSaveSession builds sessionSummary and passes to syncGeneralProgram.
TodayView.jsx: markDone() now also fires `profiles.update({ last_workout_done_at })` when
  Supabase is ready — endurance athlete's "done" tap is now persisted, not just localStorage.
CoachDashboard.jsx: GYM MEMBERS panel shows last_session_label + exercise count + "● Session
  logged — awaiting review" when pendingVerify. Adds VERIFY SESSION ✓ button (calls verifyAthlete).
  New ATHLETES — SESSION LOG panel for endurance athletes: shows last_workout_done_at vs
  coach_verified_at, VERIFY ✓ button fires when doneAt > verifiedAt (pending review state).
DEPENDS ON: v8.2.0 + Supabase migration 20260477

## v8.2.0 — 2026-04-28 — General Fitness: routing fix, set completion, save confirmation
suggestTemplate: `some` experience routes to intermediate templates; `strength`/`general` + 5+ days
  routes to ppl_6day_intermediate instead of mismatched ul_4day_beginner; `general` + 4 days explicit.
  7 new routing tests added (4306 total, 242 files).
SessionLogger: per-set ✓ button — tap to mark set done; row dims to 50% opacity, set number
  replaced with green ✓. State lives in `doneSets` map keyed by "rowIdx-setIdx". Grid extended
  to 6 columns to fit new button.
GeneralFitness: `savedJustNow` state shows green "✓ Session logged. Great work." banner for 3s
  after save before Today screen settles. Bilingual.
DEPENDS ON: v12.3.5 (suggestTemplate, SessionLogger, GeneralFitness, SEED_EXERCISES)

## v12.3.5 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness: rest timer, PR detection, deload hint, milestones
strengthTraining.js: computeSessionPRs(currentSession, priorSessions, exerciseDefs) — compares
  estimated 1RM per exercise against all prior sessions; returns new records with name, new1RM,
  prev1RM. 10 new tests (4299 total).
SessionLogger: REST Xs button per exercise row starts an inline countdown with a shrinking
  progress bar; turns green and shows "Go!" at zero; one timer at a time; dismissable.
GeneralFitness: deloadHint — computed from exerciseHistory: majority of today's exercises
  returning reason=deload triggers hint. computeSessionPRs called after each session save;
  PRs stored in lastSessionPRs state and passed to dashboard.
GeneralDashboard: NEW RECORD strip shows after session save with est. 1RM per exercise and
  delta from previous best; dismissable. Deload hint strip (subtle grey). Session milestone
  strip fires at 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 sessions_completed.
DEPENDS ON: v12.3.4 (SEED_EXERCISES, exerciseHistory, gapDayMap, currentDay in root)

---

## v12.3.4 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness: plate calculator, first-session guidance, RIR hint, muscle frequency
strengthTraining.js: plateCalculator(targetKg, barKg) — plates per side from standard set
  (20/15/10/5/2.5/1.25 kg); weeklyMuscleFrequency(sessions, exerciseDefs) — counts how many
  sessions each muscle was hit this week. 15 new tests (4289 total).
SessionLogger: plate breakdown shown in suggestion line for barbell exercises
  ("Plates per side: 20 + 10"); first-session guidance block for no_history (blue hint
  "start with a weight you can do 15+ reps comfortably"); RIR footnote on first exercise
  card only ("RIR = reps left in tank · 2 = could do 2 more · 0 = max effort").
GeneralDashboard: THIS WEEK muscle frequency strip — each hit muscle shown as a pill
  (green if ≥2×, dim if 1×); accepts exercises prop for frequency computation.
  estimatedMinutes prop accepted but was already added in v12.3.3.
DEPENDS ON: v12.3.3 (session shape s.exercises, SEED_EXERCISES with primary_muscle)

---

## v12.3.3 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness: fix analytics + ProgramView + beginner UX
BUG: GeneralInsights read s.strength_sets — sessions are saved as s.exercises → analytics
  (volume chart, progression chart) were always empty. Fixed to read s.exercises with
  per-exercise flatMap into per-set list; exercise_id carried through for muscle mapping.
BUG: ProgramView filtered templateExercises by day_index but received SEED_EXERCISES →
  program tab was blank. Fixed: use day.exercises inline from TEMPLATE_PROGRAM_DATA;
  exercises prop now only used for name lookup.
FEATURE: Form cues in SessionLogger — "▼ cues" toggle per exercise shows cues_en/tr from
  SEED_EXERCISES (e.g. "Bar on traps, chest up, descend until thighs parallel").
FEATURE: Session duration estimate on GeneralDashboard Next Session card — computed from
  prescription (sets × rest_seconds + sets × reps_high × 3s work time), shown as "~45 min".
4274 tests green.
DEPENDS ON: v12.3.2 (TEMPLATE_PROGRAM_DATA, SEED_EXERCISES with cues fields)

---

## v12.3.2 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness: coach-member link
General fitness users become members/athletes of their coach via the existing invite
system (SP-XXXXXXXX codes, coach_athletes table, redeem-invite edge function — unchanged).
Migration 20260476: profiles.general_program JSONB + confirmed_at + confirmed_by columns;
coach_confirm_general_program() SECURITY DEFINER RPC (validates active coach-athlete link).
generalFitnessSync.js: syncGeneralProgram (push state to profiles), getGeneralMembers
(fetch GF athletes for coach), confirmGeneralProgram (call RPC).
GeneralFitness.jsx: syncs user_mode='general' and program state to Supabase on onboarding
and session save; reads confirmed_at on mount; passes coachConfirmedAt to GeneralDashboard.
GeneralDashboard.jsx: shows "✓ Program confirmed by your coach" (green) or
"Awaiting coach review…" (dim) badge under Next Session card.
CoachDashboard.jsx: GYM MEMBERS panel shows all general-fitness athletes with template name,
sessions count, last session date, and CONFIRM PROGRAM button. 4274 tests green.
DEPENDS ON: v12.3.1 (general_program column from 20260476), existing coach_athletes + invite system

---

## v12.3.1 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness: wire history + prescription to SessionLogger + ProgramView
GeneralFitness.jsx: compute exerciseHistory (buildExerciseHistory), gapDayMap (buildGapDays),
currentDay (getCurrentDayData) on each render. Both SessionLogger instances (overlay + Log tab)
now receive preloadedExercises, history, gapDays, initialLabel — prescription auto-populates
rows, load suggestions fire, gap-aware deload/reorientation activates.
ProgramView now receives programDays from TEMPLATE_PROGRAM_DATA and SEED_EXERCISES — full
day-by-day exercise list visible in Program tab. 4274 tests green.
DEPENDS ON: v12.3.0 (TEMPLATE_PROGRAM_DATA, buildExerciseHistory, buildGapDays, getCurrentDayData,
  SessionLogger preloadedExercises/history/gapDays props)

---

## v12.3.0 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness: rotation pointer + no-shame resume protocol
E1: Rotation pointer replaces calendar. user_programs: end_date dropped, start_date renamed
reference_date, next_day_index + sessions_completed + last_session_date added (migration 20260474).
advanceRotation() wraps modulo template length — no deadlines, no missed-day guilt.
daysSinceLastSession() — pure date math, no prescriptions.
E2: Onboarding cut from 4 to 3 steps. Session-length field removed. "Train for a sport" option
removed from general track. Days-per-week reframed as advisory frequency (no commitment).
Anti-overcommitment guardrail: beginner + 5+day selection silently overrides to 3-day template.
E3: GeneralDashboard rebuilt around one card: Next Session (day label, exercise preview, START →
CTA). Gap line: descriptive only ("Last session: 4 days ago", "Welcome back." for >14d gaps).
No streaks, no MEV/MAV/MRV on today screen. Volume + progression charts moved to new Insights
tab. Inner tabs renamed: Today | Log | Program | Insights.
E4: Resume protocol — gap-aware suggestNextLoad(history, exercise, gap_days). 14–30d: hold at
last load. 30–90d: 90% load + rep range +2. 90+d: 80% load + rep range +3 + reorientation flag.
SessionLogger shows "Coming back — light first session" on reorientation. Forbidden copy list
enforced. exercise_last_seen view added (migration 20260475).
23 new tests (99 total in strengthTraining), 4274 total tests, 242 files, all green.
DEPENDS ON: migration 20260472 (user_programs.start_date must exist to rename).

---

## v12.2.0 — 2026-04-27 — General Fitness track: strength training for sedentary users
New user track alongside endurance. Onboarding wizard (goal→experience→schedule→equipment),
9 program templates (PPL, Upper/Lower, Full Body × bw/home/gym), 38 seed exercises (EN+TR),
set-by-set SessionLogger with linear progression suggestions (suggestNextLoad), weekly
volume chart against MEV/MAV/MRV (Schoenfeld 2017), progression SVG chart.
Science: strengthTraining.js (estimate1RM Epley/Brzycki/Lombardi, rirToPercent1RM Helms 2016,
volumeLandmarks, volumeStatus, suggestNextLoad, suggestTemplate). 76 new tests, 4251 total.
DB: migrations 20260472 (7 new tables, RLS) + 20260473 (backfill endurance users).
GYM/SALON tab added to nav. Zero endurance regressions.
DEPENDS ON: profiles table (user_mode column), auth.users.

---

## v12.1.8 — 2026-04-27 — CI: continue-on-error for migration step in e2e workflow
Branch is created from production so schema is always current.
Migration push fails only due to history drift (remote versions not in local dir).
Adding continue-on-error: true lets Playwright tests run regardless of drift.

---

## v12.1.7 — 2026-04-27 — CI: add --include-all to db push, fix migration history drift
branches get JSON returns no project_ref so branch_ref falls back to parent project.
db push was failing: "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory"
because production has migrations not tracked in local supabase/migrations/.
Fix: --include-all skips the remote history check and applies all local migrations.

---

## v12.1.6 — 2026-04-27 — CI: fix db push CLI API in e2e + rls-pentest
Current supabase CLI db push no longer accepts --project-ref or --branch flags.
Fixed both workflows: extract branch project_ref from branches get JSON,
link to it with `supabase link --project-ref`, then `supabase db push --linked`.
Also consolidated rls-pentest to single branches get call. actionlint CLEAN.

---

## v12.1.5 — 2026-04-27 — CI: fix secrets context in job-level if condition
e2e-critical-paths: removed `if: ${{ secrets.X != '' }}` from job level —
secrets context is not allowed in job.if (only github/inputs/needs/vars are valid).
Verified with actionlint v1.7.12: both workflow files now CLEAN.

---

## v12.1.4 — 2026-04-27 — CI: fix YAML syntax error in rls-pentest.yml
Template literal in github-script body had lines at column 1 (** markdown bold),
breaking YAML block scalar parsing — YAML scanner tried to interpret ** as an alias.
Fixed by rewriting body as array.join('\n') keeping all content at proper indentation.

---

## v12.1.3 — 2026-04-27 — CI: restore e2e + rls-pentest auto-triggers
Supabase secrets configured. e2e-critical-paths: pull_request + push triggers restored.
rls-pentest: weekly Monday 02:00 UTC cron restored. Both workflows fully active.

---

## v12.1.2 — 2026-04-27 — CI: disable auto-triggers on e2e + rls-pentest
e2e-critical-paths: removed pull_request + push triggers (requires Supabase Pro branching).
rls-pentest: removed weekly schedule cron (requires Supabase Pro branching + secrets).
Both workflows remain manually triggerable via workflow_dispatch.
Re-enable by restoring triggers once SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN secret is configured.

---

## v12.1.1 — 2026-04-27 — lint fix
9 unused-var warnings → 0; restored --max-warnings 0 CI green. Removed dead ZONE_KEYS/ZONE_LABEL/ZONE_LABEL_TR (RaceGoalDashCard), unused `lang` (RaceGoalAnalyzerCard), unused currentPaces destructure (trainingBridge.js), unused STATUS + selectedProg (ProgramSelectorCard), unused isPlanConfirmed + statusColor imports (CoachGateCard).

---

## v12.1.0 — 2026-04-27
E90–E93: Static programs + mandatory coach confirmation gate. (E90) trainingPrograms.js: 3 static programs (10K 24w, HM 18w, Marathon 18w), 15 named WEEK_PATTERNS; buildStaticPlan() expands to typed week array with bilingual descriptions, VDOT-derived paces, deload weeks, phase labels (Base/Build/Peak/Taper); getCurrentStaticWeek() date cursor. (E91) coachConfirmFlow.js: state machine none→draft→pending_review→confirmed/modified→active; solo athletes self-confirm (bypass review); isGated() returns true until confirmed; statusLabel/statusColor helpers; hardcoded as mandatory rule. (E92) ProgramSelectorCard.jsx: VDOT-matched program browser with programScore() ranking, expandable detail rows, solo/coach submit button; hides itself after plan is confirmed. (E93) CoachGateCard.jsx: always-visible status gate across all 5 statuses; shows pending/confirmed/active state; "Start Plan" CTA transitions CONFIRMED→ACTIVE; Dashboard.jsx gates TrainingBridgeCard + RaceGoalDashCard behind isGated() in both simplified and advanced paths. 72 new tests (trainingPrograms 44, coachConfirmFlow 28) → 4175 tests, 241 files.

---

## v12.0.0 — 2026-04-27
E85–E89: Auto-VDOT + multi-modal paces sprint — connects log, plan, and zones into a live daily training system. (E85) vdotTracker.js: detectVdotFromLog() scans training log for running entries with distance data (distanceM/distanceKm/distance variants), estimates VDOT via vdotFromRace() per entry, returns best recent within 90-day window + 12-point chronological trend; confidence: high(race)/medium(≥5K)/low; filters cycling/swim by type regex. (E86) paceZoneTranslator.js: translateAllZones(vdot, maxHR) produces full multi-modal output for all 5 Daniels zones (E/M/T/I/R): formatted pace/km, HR range in bpm+%HRmax (Friel 2009 zones: E 60–79%, M 80–87%, T 88–92%, I 93–97%, R 97–100%), RPE on CR-10, feel/purpose/format strings EN+TR. Athletes see HOW hard, not just how fast. (E87) RaceGoalDashCard.jsx: compact daily card wiring auto-VDOT status bar with confidence badge, TSB freshness indicator, today's TSB-adapted session with full multi-modal zones, weekly TSS compliance bar; TSB < −20 downgrades session to Easy automatically (Gabbett 2016). (E88) TrainingBridgeCard.jsx (rewrite): tappable week grid — each session row expands inline to full SessionDetail panel (pace/HR/RPE/feel/format/purpose from E86); plan-vs-log TSS compliance strip; TSB < −20 warning banner. (E89) VdotProgressCard.jsx: SVG VDOT trend chart (actual orange line vs expected blue dashed trajectory), on-track/ahead/behind status badge (±1.5 VDOT threshold), Daniels 5K time trial reminder every 84 days, checkpoint row from raceGoalEngine phases. Dashboard.jsx: RaceGoalDashCard + VdotProgressCard added to both beginner and advanced paths. 63 new tests (vdotTracker 38, paceZoneTranslator 25) → 4103 tests, 239 files, clean build.

## v11.94.0 — 2026-04-27
E80–E84: Race Goal Intelligence sprint. Complete "50:00 → 40:00 / 10K" end-to-end flow. (E80) raceGoalEngine.js: analyzeRaceGoal(currentTimeSec, goalTimeSec, distanceM, profile, log) → currentVdot/goalVdot (Daniels 1979), vdotGap, weeksToGoal (3.5/2.5/1.5/0.8 VDOT/block by fitness tier), 5-zone Daniels training paces, feasibility label (achievable/ambitious/stretch/extreme), physiological parameters labeled MEASURED/CALCULATED/DERIVED/PREDICTED (maxHR Tanaka 2001, LTHR Friel 87%, threshold HR range Coggan, T-pace from VDOT), CTL-based safe weekly TSS (Gabbett 2016 +5% ramp), 4-phase plan breakdown, VDOT checkpoints every 12 weeks. parseMmSs helper. (E81) RaceGoalAnalyzerCard.jsx: form (distance selector, current/goal MM:SS inputs, optional plan start date) + full science panel: current VDOT→goal VDOT with feasibility badge, current paces (live-use), goal paces (greyed targets), predicted parameters with colored labels, phase plan, checkpoints, Daniels/Tanaka/Gabbett footnotes. (E82) trainingBridge.js: buildTrainingPlan(analysis, startDate) week-by-week sessions at CURRENT VDOT paces (Base/Build/Peak/Taper + Deload every 4th week, Bompa 2015 3:1 ratio); getCurrentPlanWeek() date-based cursor. (E83) TrainingBridgeCard.jsx: active phase badge, today's session highlight, full week session grid (today highlighted), 4-week lookahead strip. (E84) Dashboard integration: both paths show RaceGoalAnalyzerCard + TrainingBridgeCard after DailyBriefingCard. 62 new tests (raceGoalEngine 44, trainingBridge 18) → 4040 tests, 237 files, clean build.

---

## v11.89.0 — 2026-04-27
E75–E79 Training Intelligence sprint. (E75) Training Phase Badge: classifyTrainingPhase() in trainingPhase.js — base/build/peak/taper/recovery via CTL trend + race proximity; badge in DailyBriefingCard header. (E76) IntensityBalanceCard: computeIntensityBalance() in intensityBalance.js — 4-week easy/hard split bar, Seiler 2010 polarized target ≥75% easy; added to beginner+advanced Dashboard paths. (E77) ACWR Live Spike Warning: projectedACWR useMemo in QuickAddModal — computes ratio including current session's TSS, shows amber △ warning when >1.3 (Gabbett 2016). (E78) Deload Detector: detectDeloadNeed() in deloadDetector.js — weekly TSS map + consecutive CTL-building weeks count; △ warning in DailyBriefingCard after 3+ build weeks or 4+ weeks without deload (Bompa 2015 3:1 ratio). (E79) WeekSessionTypeCard: this-week sessions grouped easy/moderate/hard by RPE with mini colored strip; added to beginner+advanced Dashboard paths. 29 new tests (trainingPhase 10, intensityBalance 11, deloadDetector 8) → 3978 tests, 235 files.

---

## v11.84.0 — 2026-04-27
E70–E74 Engagement & Delight sprint. (E70) PR Celebration: detectPRs() called after QuickAddModal save; 🏆 orange pulse banner lists new personal records (longest session, highest TSS, weekly TSS, streak, power peaks). (E71) Formula ⓘ popovers: FormulaPopover.jsx + formulaInfo.js covering CTL, ATL, TSB, ACWR, VDOT, FTP, W/kg, LTHR — applied to DailyBriefingCard, EliteMetricsStrip, AllZonesCard, ConsistencyDepthCard, WeeklyReviewCard. (E72) MonthlyProgressCard: shows prev-month sessions/TSS/CTL delta/best week/next-month target on 1st–7th of each month; both Dashboard paths.

---

## v11.79.0 — 2026-04-27
General app audit fixes. (1) App.jsx: `profile` was not destructured from useAppState — QuickAddModal was receiving undefined profile (no sport defaults, no zone hints). Fixed by adding `profile` to the destructuring. (2) isoWeekLabel: replaced broken formula with correct ISO 8601 nearest-Thursday algorithm using noon-UTC parsing to avoid timezone boundary shifts; was returning W16 instead of W17 for Apr 25 on UTC servers. (3) aerobicEfficiency.test.js: corrected "same week" test — Apr 25 (W17) and Apr 27 (W18) cross a week boundary; changed to Apr 22 (W17). All CI-blocking issues resolved. 3886 tests, 0 lint warnings.

---

## v11.78.0 — 2026-04-27
Lint clean-up: fixed all 60 ESLint problems (1 error + 59 warnings) that were blocking CI. RowingMetricsCard.jsx: hoisted conditional useMemo before early return (Rules of Hooks). Protocols.jsx + LactateEstimator.jsx: removed stale useMemo deps. PolarizationComplianceCard.jsx: stabilised safeLog reference. 35 files: unused vars/args prefixed with _ or imports removed. 0 lint problems, 3886 tests.

---

## v11.77.0 — 2026-04-27
Formula audit + interconnection fixes. All 15 formulas verified correct (Tanaka 208−0.7×age, LTHR ×0.87, Coggan 7 zones, CTL K=1−e^{−1/42}, ATL K=1−e^{−1/7}, ACWR=ATL/CTL, Daniels VDOT, Foster monotony/strain, W' Skiba, Riegel, NP, FTP ×0.95, W/kg). Fixes: (1) QuickAddModal TSS now uses profile-derived HR zone IF midpoints (zone-based: t_hours×IF²×100) when profile has maxhr/age — falls back to generic RPE estimate when not; closes FTP-TSS interconnection gap. (2) intelligence.js predictInjuryRisk now accepts profile param and applies sport-specific monotony threshold (cycling 2.4, triathlon 1.8, running 2.0 — Foster 1998). (3) Same call sites wired: nextAction.js, Recovery.jsx, AthleteDetailPanel.jsx, generateWeeklyNarrative. (4) getTodayPlannedSession timezone bug fixed: day-of-week now parsed as noon UTC to prevent UTC±N mismatch on midnight boundaries. 3886 tests, 230 files.

---

## v11.76.0 — 2026-04-26
E66+E68+E69: Prescription loop round 2. E66: TodayView readiness gates prescription — when todayReadiness<50 shows yellow "⚠ Readiness LOW" banner above plan card; when not yet logged today shows compact 3-tap check-in (😴 Tired=25 / 😐 Okay=60 / ⚡ Ready=90) ABOVE plan card, tapping calls onSaveRecovery+shows 2s "Logged ✓"; readiness tile added to quick stats row. E68: QuickAddModal post-session analysis — zone mismatch flag (easy+RPE≥8 or hard+RPE≤3 → yellow warning strip EN/TR); tomorrow nudge strip from dailyPrescription(profile, log+savedEntry).tomorrow.suggestion. E69: WeeklyReviewCard (this week vs last week TSS+sessions with delta, generateWeeklyNarrative insight) + ConsistencyDepthCard (n→CTL reliability thresholds, #ff6600 progress bar, milestone markers 0/14/42/84), both in beginner+advanced Dashboard paths. 3886 tests, 232 files.

---

## v11.72.0 — 2026-04-26
E65+E67: Prescription loop round 1. E65: dailyPrescription.js — pure coaching engine dailyPrescription(profile,log,plan,planStatus,recovery,metrics); outputs status/tsb/ctl/acwr, zone-annotated session targets, tomorrow suggestion, sessionFlag fn, ACWR+monotony warnings; TYPE_TO_ZONE mapping, TSB status thresholds (fresh/optimal/normal/fatigued/very-fatigued); DailyBriefingCard.jsx in both Dashboard paths (status badge, brief headline, session block with zone+HR+pace+power ranges, tomorrow nudge, warnings strip, CTL/TSB/ACWR row); 47 tests. E67: Offline indicator + Strava CTA — QuickAddModal shows ⚡ offline badge when navigator.onLine=false and sync status in confirmation panel; GettingStartedCard gains Strava connect CTA (#fc4c02) when !stravaConnected; App.jsx fires 8s auto-dismiss toast after 3rd manual log if no strava token (once only, sporeus-strava-nudge-shown localStorage key). 3886 tests, 230 files.

## v11.68.0 — 2026-04-26
E60–E64: Elite athlete profile propagation engine. E60: profileDerivedMetrics.js — universal profile→metrics engine; deriveAllMetrics(profile,log,testResults) derives W/kg, 7 Coggan power zones, 5 Daniels paces, 5 HR zones (Tanaka age-predicted maxHR, 87% LTHR), auto-VDOT from best log session, profile completeness 0–100 with feature-unlock map; 53 tests. E61: QuickAddModal zone-aware RPE — real-time zone hint below RPE buttons: "RPE 7 → Z4 · 145–163 bpm · 3:21/km" using profile-derived metrics. E62: EliteMetricsStrip — compact W/kg·VDOT·MaxHR·LTHR strip in both Dashboard modes (≥2 metrics threshold). E63: AllZonesCard — lazy-loaded reference card (Coggan 7 power zones + Daniels 5 paces + 5 HR zones) in advanced Dashboard. E64: Profile completeness section — score/progress bar/missing fields/feature-unlock list + auto-VDOT nudge with one-click pre-fill. 3839 tests, 229 files.

---

## v11.63.0 — 2026-04-26
E56–E59: Daily-use bug fixes. E56: QuickAddModal — date picker (type=date, max=today, default=today) so athletes can log past sessions; entry uses selected date; confirmation shows date if not today. E57: TrainingLog — single-row delete now requires confirmation (inline confirm row with Cancel/Delete, session type+duration shown; also fixed latent index-based filter bug → id-based). E58: Profile — raceDate field added (type=date) so TodayView race countdown is reachable; raceDate in sanitizeProfile + LangCtx. E59: Dashboard — WeeklyTssGoalCard added to beginner mode path; CTL label gets title tooltip. DAILY_USE_RULES.md created. 3786 tests.

- Fix: split each `FOR ALL` into explicit `SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE` policies, merging both SELECT conditions into one `OR` clause per table
- Tables fixed: `ai_insights`, `coach_invites`, `coach_plans`, `coach_sessions`, `consents`, `injuries`, `profiles`, `race_results`, `recovery`, `session_attendance`, `team_announcements`, `test_results`, `training_log`
- `consents_service_read` dropped entirely — `service_role` bypasses RLS; policy was a no-op

**`supabase/migrations/20260468_profiles_language_first_touch.sql`**:
- `profiles.language TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'tr' CHECK (language IN ('en','tr'))` — was in master reference but absent from live schema
- `profiles.first_touch JSONB` — attribution first-touch payload; written once, never overwritten

**`supabase/migrations/20260469_fix_generated_reports_rls_initplan.sql`**:
- `generated_reports: own rows` policy replaced with `(SELECT auth.uid())` subquery pattern to eliminate per-row re-evaluation (`auth_rls_initplan` WARN)

**Advisor state after**: 0 WARN performance · 0 WARN security (residual: extension_in_public + auth_leaked_password_protection — Dashboard-only, not fixable via migration)

## [v11.10.0] — 2026-04-24

### FEAT: 7 missing cron jobs + 3 DB functions

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_missing_crons_and_fns.sql`**:

**DB functions created**:
- `increment_upload_count(p_user_id uuid)` — increments `profiles.monthly_upload_count`; called by parse-activity (non-fatal)
- `reset_monthly_upload_count()` — zeroes upload counters on 1st of month
- `maybe_refresh_squad_mv()` — refreshes `mv_squad_readiness` CONCURRENTLY only if training_log was touched in last 2 min (debounced)

**Schema**: `profiles.monthly_upload_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` added

**Cron jobs added (now 21 total)**:
| Job | Schedule | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `check-dependencies` | `*/5 * * * *` | check-dependencies edge fn |
| `alert-monitor` | `* * * * *` | alert-monitor edge fn |
| `operator-digest-weekly` | `0 5 * * 1` | operator-digest edge fn (Mon 08:00 Istanbul) |
| `maybe-refresh-squad-mv` | `* * * * *` | `maybe_refresh_squad_mv()` DB fn (debounced) |
| `reset-file-upload-month` | `0 0 1 * *` | `reset_monthly_upload_count()` DB fn |
| `generate-report-weekly` | `30 3 * * 1` | generate-report batch=weekly |
| `generate-report-monthly-squad` | `0 4 1 * *` | generate-report batch=monthly_squad |

---

## [v11.9.0] — 2026-04-24

### DEPLOY: final 5 edge functions — all 25/25 now active

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_pre_deploy_schema_fixes.sql`**:
- `operator_alerts.notified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false` — required by operator-digest email tracking
- `system_status.latency_ms INTEGER` — written by check-dependencies probe results
- `generated_reports` table (uuid PK, user_id, kind weekly|monthly_squad|race_readiness, storage_path, params, expires_at) + RLS own-rows policy + 2 indexes + `purge-generated-reports` cron (45 3 * * *)
- `reports` storage bucket (private) + deny-public storage policy
- `get_recent_client_errors(p_limit int)` RPC — aggregates client_events WHERE event_type='error' last 24h, used by operator-digest

**`supabase/functions/check-dependencies/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- Pings supabase_api, strava_api, anthropic_api, dodo_payments, stripe in parallel; upserts system_status; fires operator_alerts for any 'down' service

**`supabase/functions/operator-digest/index.ts`** (v1 deployed, with fix):
- Weekly email digest: MAU/DAU, tier counts, queue health, system status, top errors, alert summary
- FIX: `notified` update now uses `eq('id', digestRow.id)` instead of invalid `order+limit` on update

**`supabase/functions/public-api/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- GET /api/v1/squad, /api/v1/squad/export, /api/v1/athlete/:id/load
- Club-tier API key auth + 100 req/hour rate limit via request_counts

**`supabase/functions/adjust-coach-plan/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- DB webhook on injuries INSERT; reduces coach_plans week volume 20–40% based on severity; writes coach_notes

**`supabase/functions/generate-report/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- React PDF reports: weekly athlete summary, monthly squad overview, race readiness one-pager
- Uploads to reports storage bucket; inserts generated_reports row; returns 7-day signed URL
- Batch mode (pg_cron): weekly for all coach/club users; monthly_squad for coaches

---

## [v11.8.0] — 2026-04-24

### DEPLOY: ops tables + 5 edge functions (squad-sync, parse-activity, alert-monitor, ingest-telemetry, push-worker already done)

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_ops_tables.sql`**:
- `operator_alerts` (bigserial PK, kind, severity warning|critical, title, body, fired_at) — alert dedup table for alert-monitor; idx on (kind, fired_at DESC)
- `system_status` (service PK, status up|down|degraded|unknown, message, checked_at) — written by check-dependencies, read by alert-monitor
- `client_events` (bigserial PK, session_id, user_id_hash, event_type, category, action, label, value, page, app_version, created_at) — telemetry sink; idx on created_at DESC and session_id
- All tables: RLS enabled + deny-public policy (service_role BYPASSRLS only)
- Cron jobid=13: `purge-client-events` `30 3 * * *` — 30-day TTL for client_events

**`supabase/functions/squad-sync/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- Auth user → calls `get_squad_overview(p_coach_id)` RPC → returns squad data

**`supabase/functions/parse-activity/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- FIT and GPX file parsers; inserts into training_log; updates activity_upload_jobs
- Uses dynamic import of fit-file-parser@2.3.3 and fast-xml-parser@4

**`supabase/functions/alert-monitor/index.ts`** (v1 deployed):
- Checks: queue depth SLOs (ai_batch 100, strava_backfill 500, push_fanout 200), DLQ non-empty, system_status service=down, push failure spike >20/10min, stale system_status >10min
- 15-minute dedup window via operator_alerts table; fired via pg_cron

**`supabase/functions/ingest-telemetry/index.ts`** (v1 deployed, with fix):
- Receives batched client events (up to 50/batch); validates event_type whitelist; inserts into client_events
- FIX: removed erroneous `ts` field from insert rows — column is `created_at` with DEFAULT now()

---

## [v11.7.0] — 2026-04-24

### DEPLOY: push-worker edge function (v1)

**`supabase/functions/push-worker/index.ts`** (first deploy, was missing):
- Drains `push_fanout` pgmq queue; processes up to 50 messages per minute in 10-msg parallel batches
- Calls `send-push` with `Bearer ${serviceKey}` per message; treats 404 (no subscriptions) as success
- Uses `read_push_fanout` + `delete_push_fanout_msg` RPCs; VT=30s for at-least-once delivery

**Effect**: Cron jobid=12 (`push-worker` `* * * * *`) now has a real function to invoke. Checkin reminder push notifications from `trigger-checkin-reminders` will be delivered end-to-end.

---

## [v11.6.0] — 2026-04-24

### FIX: comment-notification auth + add missing push-worker cron

**`supabase/functions/comment-notification/index.ts`** (v3):
- `webhookAuth = req.headers.get('Authorization') || Bearer ${serviceKey}` — DB trigger delivers a hardcoded service_role JWT in the Authorization header; forward it directly to send-push instead of constructing from `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` env var. Eliminates the send-push 401 that occurred when the env var was not available.
- `authHeader = webhookAuth` — no other logic changed

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_add_push_worker_cron.sql`**:
- Cron jobid=12: `push-worker` `* * * * *` — drains `push_fanout` pgmq queue; was missing (trigger-checkin-reminders enqueues to this queue but no worker was consuming it)

**Effect**: Comment push notifications will succeed for real users. Checkin reminder push notifications from the fanout queue will now be delivered.

---

## [v11.5.0] — 2026-04-24

### FEAT: AI pipeline activation — embed trigger + backfill + MV security

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_enhancements_embed_trigger_mv_revoke.sql`**:

**MV security**: REVOKE SELECT on `mv_ctl_atl_daily`, `mv_weekly_load_summary`, `mv_squad_readiness` from `anon`, `authenticated` — MVs have no RLS; all rows were readable by any authenticated user. Only `generate-report` (service_role, BYPASSRLS) uses them.

**Auto-embed trigger** (`on_training_log_embed`, SECURITY DEFINER):
- `trg_training_log_embed_insert` — AFTER INSERT on training_log → calls embed-session via net.http_post with service_role JWT
- `trg_training_log_embed_update` — AFTER UPDATE WHEN (`notes`, `type`, `tss`, `rpe`, or `duration_min` changed) → same call
- embed-session content_hash dedup handles idempotency

**Backfill**:
- `embed_backfill_batch(batch_size int)` — finds up to N sessions with no session_embeddings row, calls embed-session per session
- Cron jobid=11: `embed-backfill` `*/10 * * * *` — processes 50 unembedded sessions every 10 min; self-terminating (no-op when all embedded)

**Effect**: SemanticSearch and SquadPatternSearch now produce real results once EMBEDDING_API_KEY sessions begin populating.

---

## [v11.4.2] — 2026-04-24

### FIX: Security + performance hardening round 2 (advisor sweep)

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_security_perf_hardening_round2.sql`**:
- `touch_updated_at` + `update_training_plan_timestamp`: added `SET search_path = ''` (trigger fns, SECURITY INVOKER)
- `consents_service_read` policy: `auth.role()` → `(SELECT auth.role())` — initplan form prevents per-row re-evaluation
- Dropped `ai_insights: service write` INSERT policy — `WITH CHECK (true)` let any authed user insert; service_role bypasses RLS, policy was only an exploit surface
- Added FK indexes: `athlete_devices(user_id)`, `messages(athlete_id)`, `profiles(coach_id)`, `request_counts(api_key)`

**Residual (acknowledged, not fixed):**
- `pg_net`, `pgtap`, `vector` extensions in public schema — Supabase-managed, cannot relocate without breaking dependencies
- 3 MVs (`mv_weekly_load_summary`, `mv_ctl_atl_daily`, `mv_squad_readiness`) accessible to authenticated — MVs don't support RLS; fix requires SECURITY DEFINER wrappers + client changes (Phase 4 candidate)
- `multiple_permissive_policies` alerts — all are intentional own-row ALL + coach-read SELECT pairs
- Leaked password protection — manual toggle in Supabase Auth dashboard

---

## [v11.4.1] — 2026-04-24

### FIX: purge-deleted-accounts cron broken (current_setting GUC never set)

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_fix_purge_cron_hardcode_jwt.sql`**:
- `app.service_role_key` GUC was NULL — cron job failed every night with JSON parse error
- Unscheduled + rescheduled with hardcoded service_role JWT (same pattern as ai-batch-worker cron)
- New jobid=10, schedule `0 4 * * *`, active

---

## [v11.4.0] — 2026-04-24

### FEAT: Phase 3 UI — SemanticSearch + SquadPatternSearch + ChatPanel + WeeklyDigestCard

**`src/App.jsx`**:
- Lazy-import `SemanticSearch` from `./components/SemanticSearch.jsx`
- `showSemanticSearch` state + Ctrl+Shift+K keyboard shortcut (coach/club tier; free-tier shows upgrade modal)
- `⊞ AI` header button (coach/club only) toggles semantic search
- Controlled `<SemanticSearch>` render inside `<Suspense fallback={null}>`; `onJumpToSession` dispatches `sporeus:jump-to-session` CustomEvent
- Footer hint updated: `· Ctrl+Shift+K = AI search`

**`src/components/CoachDashboard.jsx`**:
- Added `supabase` to import (was `isSupabaseReady` only)
- Added `sbAthleteIds` state + `useEffect` to fetch active athlete IDs from `coach_athletes` on mount
- Imports: `SquadPatternSearch`, `ChatPanel`, `WeeklyDigestCard`
- All three rendered inside `isSupabaseReady() && sbCoachId` block

**`src/components/coach/WeeklyDigestCard.jsx`** (new):
- Reads latest `weekly_digests` row for coach (`coach_id`, ordered by `week_start desc`)
- Renders: `headline`, `highlights[]`, `alerts[]`, `recommendation`, `citations[]`
- Bloomberg terminal aesthetic; "No digest yet — runs Sunday night" when empty
- Collapsible via toggle button

**Tests**: 2807/2807 ✓

---

## [v11.3.0] — 2026-04-24

### FEAT: Phase 2 AI Layer — pgvector embeddings + semantic search + AI proxy

**`supabase/migrations/20260426_ai_embeddings.sql`**:
- `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` — pgvector installed
- `session_embeddings` table: `session_id` PK FK→training_log, `user_id` FK→profiles, `embedding vector(1536)`, `content_hash text`
- `insight_embeddings` table: `insight_id` PK FK→ai_insights, `user_id` FK→profiles, `embedding vector(1536)`, `content_hash text`
- ivfflat cosine indexes on both tables (lists=100)
- RLS: own-row ALL policy on both tables (`(SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id`)
- `match_sessions_for_user(p_embedding, k)` — SECURITY DEFINER, STABLE; `OPERATOR(public.<=>)` qualified cosine distance
- `match_sessions_for_coach(p_embedding, p_athlete_ids, k)` — SECURITY DEFINER, STABLE; filters by active coach_athletes link

**Edge functions deployed (withTelemetry stripped — shared module not bundleable via MCP)**:
- `embed-session` v1 (verify_jwt=false): embeds training sessions via OpenAI text-embedding-3-small; C2 guard (skip <20 chars); C1 closure (also embeds linked ai_insights); content_hash dedup; webhook + user JWT paths
- `embed-query` v1 (verify_jwt=true): embeds search queries; calls match_sessions_for_user or match_sessions_for_coach; squad mode requires coach/club tier
- `ai-batch-worker` v1 (verify_jwt=false): drains ai_batch pgmq queue (batch_size=20, VT=30s); calls Claude Haiku-4-5 for weekly squad digest; RAG context from session embeddings (optional); retry with backoff [30s/120s/480s]; DLQ after 3 failures
- `ai-proxy` v1 (verify_jwt=true): server-side Anthropic proxy; tier enforcement (free=0, coach=50/300, club=500/1500 daily/monthly); RAG mode (embed+match_sessions); model_alias haiku/sonnet

**Cron (jobid 9)**: `ai-batch-worker` — `* * * * *` (every minute, service_role JWT)

**Notes**:
- `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` not yet set → embed-session/embed-query return 500/501; ai-batch-worker + ai-proxy work without it (RAG skipped gracefully)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` already set as `sporeus-coach-key` → ai-proxy and ai-batch-worker functional

**Depends on**: v11.2.0, migration 20260426_security_hardening_*

---

## [v11.2.0] — 2026-04-23

### PERF/SEC: Security hardening — search_path + RLS initplan + index cleanup

**`supabase/migrations/20260426_security_hardening_functions.sql`**:
- 17 SECURITY DEFINER functions: `ALTER FUNCTION ... SET search_path = ''` (bodies already schema-qualified)
- 10 functions rewritten with `public.*` table references + `SET search_path = ''`: `get_my_tier`, `get_load_timeline`, `get_squad_readiness`, `get_weekly_summary`, `refresh_mv_load`, `handle_new_user`, `increment_referral_uses`, `apply_tier_change`, `search_everything`, `get_squad_overview`

**`supabase/migrations/20260426_security_hardening_rls.sql`**:
- 59 RLS policies: bare `auth.uid()` → `(SELECT auth.uid())` initplan form (evaluated once per query, not per row)
- `coach_notes`: 3 permissive policies → 1 (drop redundant `coach_notes_coach` + `coach_notes_athlete_read`)
- `coach_sessions`: 2 SELECT policies → 1 merged `coach_sessions_select`; drop redundant `coach_sessions_coach_read`
- `messages` INSERT: `msg_athlete_insert` + `msg_coach_insert` → `msg_insert` (OR-combined)
- `messages` SELECT: `msg_athlete_select` + `msg_coach_select` → `msg_select` (OR-combined)

**`supabase/migrations/20260426_security_hardening_indexes.sql`**:
- Drop 26 unused indexes (Supabase performance advisor)
- Add 3 missing FK indexes: `activity_upload_jobs(log_entry_id)`, `coach_invites(used_by)`, `coach_notes(athlete_id)`

**Docs**: `docs/ops/security-checklist.md` — leaked password toggle, MFA, key rotation cadence, accepted risks

**Tests**: `src/lib/security.test.js` (+18 RLS invariant tests). **2807 pass total.**

**`docs/releases/v11.1.0.md`**: Phase 1 complete release notes (all 3 blocks)

**Depends on**: v11.1.1, migrations 20260453–20260425

---

## [v11.1.1] — 2026-04-23

### FEAT: KVKK/GDPR — export-user-data + purge-deleted-accounts with 30-day grace

**`supabase/migrations/20260425_data_rights.sql`**:
- `data_rights_requests` unified table (kind: export | deletion, status machine, scheduled_purge_at, export_url + expiry)
- RLS: user inserts + reads own rows; user can cancel own pending deletion; service_role updates freely
- `build_user_export(p_user_id)` SECURITY DEFINER: collects all 20 user-scoped tables, excludes `athlete_devices.token_enc` + `insight_embeddings.embedding` vector
- `purge_user(p_user_id)` SECURITY DEFINER: cascade-safe — archives coach_sessions (null coach_id), soft-deletes comments, deletes all app tables in FK order, returns jsonb result
- `user-exports` storage bucket (private, 50 MB, service-role write, signed-URL read)
- pg_cron `purge-deleted-accounts` daily 04:00 UTC

**`supabase/functions/export-user-data/index.ts`** (rewritten, no withTelemetry):
- Auth via bearer JWT; calls `build_user_export` RPC; uploads to user-exports bucket; returns 7-day signed URL + request_id

**`supabase/functions/purge-deleted-accounts/index.ts`** (rewritten, no withTelemetry):
- Service-role cron worker; processes `data_rights_requests` past `scheduled_purge_at`; calls `purge_user` then `auth.admin.deleteUser`; error isolation (failed row marked, loop continues); sends confirmation email via Resend

**`src/components/profile/DataPrivacySettings.jsx`** (new):
- "Export my data" → calls export-user-data edge function, opens download URL
- "Delete my account" → two-step modal (30-day grace explained, coach/squad impact stated)
- Pending deletion banner with date + "Cancel deletion" button
- Cancel updates `data_rights_requests.status='canceled'` via user RLS policy

**`src/contexts/LangCtx.jsx`**: +14 privacy keys under `priv*` namespace (EN + TR)

**Legal**: `docs/legal/kvkk-notice-tr.md` (KVKK No.6698 Art.10 aydınlatma metni) + `docs/legal/privacy-notice-en.md` (GDPR controller notice)

**Ops**: `docs/ops/runbooks.md` — KVKK deletion inquiry runbook, immediate purge SQL, cron job monitoring, manual export

**Tests**: `src/lib/__tests__/privacy/dataRights.test.js` (+23 tests). 2777 pass total.

**Depends on**: v11.1.0, migration 20260458 (export_jobs, deletion_requests), migration 20260460 (session_comments)

---

## [v11.1.0] — 2026-04-23

### FEAT: Billing state machine — dodo-webhook + subscription lifecycle

**`supabase/functions/dodo-webhook/index.ts`** (rewritten, 125 lines):
- HMAC-SHA256 constant-time signature verification for both Dodo (`x-dodo-signature`) and Stripe (`stripe-signature`)
- All state transitions delegated to `apply_subscription_event()` SQL RPC — function is thin I/O only
- Email side-effects on `payment.failed` and `subscription.cancelled` kept in function
- No `withTelemetry` import (MCP deploy compatible); deployed ACTIVE v1

**`supabase/migrations/20260424_subscription_state.sql`**:
- Added to profiles: `subscription_provider TEXT`, `subscription_id TEXT`, `subscription_current_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ`
- Created `subscription_events` table with `UNIQUE(event_id)`, RLS enabled, service_role grants
- Created `apply_subscription_event(p_event jsonb)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC — unified state machine:
  - `payment.succeeded` / `payment_intent.succeeded` / `invoice.payment_succeeded` → calls `apply_tier_change()`, sets provider
  - `payment.failed` / `invoice.payment_failed` → `status=past_due`, `grace_period_ends_at=now()+3days`
  - `subscription.cancelled` / `customer.subscription.deleted` → `status=cancelled`, sets `subscription_end_date`
  - `subscription.created` / `subscription.trial_start` → `status=trialing`, sets `trial_ends_at`
  - `subscription.updated` → syncs `subscription_current_period_end`
  - Idempotent: duplicate `event_id` returns `{ ok: true, duplicate: true }` — safe for Dodo/Stripe retry

**`src/hooks/useSubscription.js`** (new):
- Subscribes to `profiles` postgres_changes for the authenticated user's row
- Calls `onUpdate` with `{ subscription_status, subscription_tier, trial_ends_at, grace_period_ends_at, subscription_end_date }` — extra profile fields stripped
- Cleans up channel on unmount; re-subscribes when `userId` changes

**`src/lib/subscription.js`**:
- Added `getEffectiveTier(tier, status)`: `past_due` retains tier access (grace window); `cancelled`/`expired`/`none` reverts to `free`
- Added status predicates: `isOnTrial`, `isPastDue`, `isCancelled`, `isExpired`, `daysUntilExpiry`

**Tests**: `src/lib/subscription.test.js` (+16 tests for predicates + `getEffectiveTier`), `src/hooks/__tests__/useSubscription.test.js` (5 tests). 2754 pass.

**`docs/ops/webhooks.md`** (new): Dodo + Stripe webhook config reference — endpoint, events, metadata shape, signature rotation runbook, local test curl.

**Depends on**: v11.0.10, migrations 052–054 (processed_webhooks, subscription_hardening, apply_tier_change)

---

## [v11.0.10] — 2026-04-23

### FIX: Three logic bugs in intelligence.js and formulas.js

- **`detectMilestones` daysSpan** (`intelligence.js:485`): was using `log[0]` and `log[n-1]` assuming insertion order = date order. Backfilled sessions break this. Now uses `Math.max/min` over all timestamp values for correct span regardless of array order.
- **`wingateStats` NaN** (`formulas.js:123`): fatigue index `(peak-low)/peak` produces `NaN` when `peak=0`. Returns `'0.0'` when peak is zero.
- **Dead `_maxRPE`** (`intelligence.js:484`): unused variable removed.

**Depends on**: v11.0.9

---

## [v11.0.9] — 2026-04-23

### FEAT: DurabilityCard surface + polarization ratio + video session URL

**DurabilityCard** (`src/components/dashboard/DurabilityCard.jsx` → `Dashboard.jsx`):
- New card rendered after BanisterModelCard; self-hides when athlete has no FIT-imported sessions ≥90 min with a power stream
- Shows durability % (last-hour 5min peak ÷ baseline MMP), tier label, threshold reference grid (≥95%/90%/85%/<85%), 8-session trend bars
- O(m) sliding-window `baselineMMP5()` over last 12 months; wrapped in `memo()`
- Reference: Maunder et al. (2021) Sports Med 51:1523–1550

**Polarization ratio** (J5 sub-threshold card in `Dashboard.jsx`):
- Header now shows `{pct}% ≥80%` next to weekly sub-threshold minutes
- Green when ≥80% (Seiler target), orange when below
- Computed as sub-threshold min / total week min for current week

**Video session URL** (`SessionManager.jsx`, `coachSessions.js`, migration `20260466`):
- Coach can enter optional `meeting_url` (https://…) when creating a session
- Stored via `meeting_url` column added to `coach_sessions` table (migration `20260466_coach_sessions_meeting_url.sql`)
- Rendered as clickable "▶ Video Link" in session detail panel

**Tests**: 2740 pass · **Build**: clean

**Depends on**: v11.0.8, durabilityScore.js, subThresholdTime.js, coachSessions.js

---

## [v11.0.6] — 2026-04-23

### FIX: All ESLint errors and warnings blocking GitHub Pages deployment

**3 errors** (would break React in production):
- `LoadTrendChart.jsx` — `useState`/`useMemo` were after an early `return null`, violating rules-of-hooks; moved before the guard
- `Profile.jsx:540` — `useState(false)` called inside an IIFE JSX expression (`() => {...}()`); hoisted `dqOpen` state to component level

**16 warnings** resolved (all blocked `--max-warnings 0` lint gate):
- `FuelGuidanceCard` / `PhaseAnalyticsCard` / `WeeklyRetroCard` — unused `t` / `useContext` / `LangCtx` removed (cards use inline `lang === 'tr'` ternaries)
- `useAdaptivePlan.js` — dead `weekKey()` function and unused `today` variable removed
- `RaceReadiness.jsx` — unused `t` removed from destructure; `BLUE` renamed `_BLUE`
- `QuickAddModal.test.jsx` — unused `render` / `waitFor` imports removed
- `SessionCommentThread.jsx` — unused `lang` removed from `useContext` destructure
- `useSessionComments.js` — added `eslint-disable` comment for intentionally stable `qKey`/`qc` refs
- `nextAction.test.js` — unused `vi`, `computeCTL`, `computeATL` imports removed
- `efficiencyFactor.test.js` — unused `i` parameter replaced with `_` in `Array.from` callback
- `subThresholdTime.test.js` — unused `WEEK_END` renamed `_WEEK_END`

**Note**: deploy was already failing before this session (same pre-existing warnings). This commit unblocks it.

**Changes**: 13 files

**Depends on**: v11.0.5

---

## [v11.0.5] — 2026-04-23

### FEAT: Dashboard memo optimization, weekly retrospective, phase analytics, fuel guidance

**Dashboard React.memo (6 components)**
Wrapped `InsightsPanel`, `WeekStoryCard`, `YourPatternsCard`, `DidYouKnowCard`, `RaceReadinessCard`, and `LoadTrendChart` in `React.memo`. These components now skip re-render when their props haven't changed. Prevents full cascade re-render when `profile`, `recovery`, or `injuries` update independently of `log`.

**WeeklyRetroCard**
New compact card at top of dashboard showing last week's structured summary: sessions count, total TSS, volume (h/m), top session, average readiness score, average HRV, and adaptive plan adherence % with color-coded status badge. Pulls from `useAdaptivePlan` for plan compliance message.

**PhaseAnalyticsCard**
New phase-aware metrics card. Reads current periodization plan + `MACRO_PHASES` to show: current phase name (Base/Build/Peak/Recovery/Taper/Race) with phase progress bar, CTL delta from phase start to now, phase compliance % (actual vs planned TSS across all completed weeks in this phase), and current week TSS progress against target.

**FuelGuidanceCard**
New CHO periodization card based on Burke et al. 2011 + Moore 2014. Shows: today's CHO target range (g/kg and absolute grams) derived from today's TSS, tomorrow's CHO target if plan has a session, daily protein range (1.6–2.2g/kg), and hydration estimate based on training volume. CHO zones: rest 3-5g/kg, easy 5-7, moderate 7-10, hard 10-12, very hard 12-14g/kg.

## [v11.0.4] — 2026-04-23

### FEAT: App-wide improvements — HRV readiness weighting, workout templates, PMC timeline, adaptive plan, golden tests, i18n completeness, GDPR fix, AI per-tier caps

**Wave 1 — GDPR purge fix**
`purgeExpiredData` was referencing dead tables `wellness_logs` and `sessions`, silently no-oping on `recovery` and `injuries` data. Fixed `purgeTables` to target the correct tables. GDPR data retention now enforces deletion of recovery and injury records.

**Wave 2 — AI per-tier monthly cost caps**
Replaced flat `MONTHLY_CAP = 1500` in `ai-proxy` edge function with per-tier map: `free: 0, coach: 300, club: 1500`. Free-tier users now blocked (0 cap), Coach users capped at 300/month.

**Wave 3 — Protocols: DataContext save + zone auto-assignment**
`Protocols.jsx` was writing directly to `localStorage` via `saveBoth()` and `useFTP()`, bypassing React state and Supabase sync. Both now route through `setProfile` from `useData()`. `useFTP()` also auto-computes `powerZones(ftp)` and stores them on save.

**Wave 4 — HRV-weighted readiness score**
`TodayView.jsx` quick-save now multiplies wellness readiness score by an HRV factor: `unstable → 0.75`, `warning → 0.90`, `stable → 1.0`. Requires ≥3 days of HRV data to apply the factor; otherwise defaults to 1.0.

**Wave 5 — Workout templates**
New `useWorkoutTemplates.js` hook (localStorage, max 30 templates). `QuickAddModal` shows a 6-template picker that pre-fills type/duration/rpe/notes; has a "Save as template" button after logging. `TrainingLog` adds a ⊕ button on each session row to save it as a template.

**Wave 6 — PMC range selector + career peak CTL**
`LoadTrendChart.jsx` now has 90D/6M/1Y/ALL range buttons for the Performance Management Chart. Displays career peak CTL (highest CTL ever computed across all history) as a reference point.

**Wave 7 — Adaptive plan adherence**
New `useAdaptivePlan.js` hook compares actual vs planned weekly TSS, classifies adherence status (on_track/under/low/exceeded/overreach), and computes an adjusted next-week TSS. `Periodization.jsx` shows `AdaptivePlanCard` with bilingual EN/TR messaging, dismissable per week.

**Wave 8 — Scientific golden-file tests**
New `src/lib/__tests__/trainingLoad.golden.test.js` with 12 reference-value assertions: Banister K_CTL/K_ATL constants, ATL convergence rate, ACWR status classification (Hulin 2016), and Foster 2001 monotony/strain properties including the >2.0 flag threshold.

**Wave 9 — i18n completeness**
Added 16 missing EN+TR translation keys to `LangCtx.jsx`: `pmcTitle`, `pmcPeakCTL`, `periodizationTitle`, `noWeekData`, `raceAnchorHint`, `hideChart`, `showChart`, `loadingCoachPlans`, `alreadySubmitted`, `wprimePower*` (3 error keys), `cooperDistance`. Updated `LoadTrendChart`, `Protocols`, `TodayView`, `Periodization` to use `t()` for all previously hardcoded English strings.

**Changes**:
- `src/lib/gdprExport.js` — purgeTables now targets `recovery` + `injuries` (not dead `wellness_logs`/`sessions`)
- `supabase/functions/ai-proxy/index.ts` — per-tier monthly caps `{ free:0, coach:300, club:1500 }`
- `src/components/Protocols.jsx` — DataContext save + auto `powerZones()` on FTP set; `t()` for 4 hardcoded strings
- `src/components/TodayView.jsx` — HRV factor multiplier on quick-save readiness; `t('alreadySubmitted')`
- `src/hooks/useWorkoutTemplates.js` — new hook (localStorage CRUD, max 30 templates)
- `src/components/QuickAddModal.jsx` — template picker (6 visible) + save-as-template after log
- `src/components/TrainingLog.jsx` — ⊕ button to save any session as template
- `src/components/dashboard/LoadTrendChart.jsx` — PMC range selector (90D/6M/1Y/ALL) + career peak CTL + `t()` for title/badge
- `src/hooks/useAdaptivePlan.js` — new adaptive plan adherence hook
- `src/components/Periodization.jsx` — AdaptivePlanCard (bilingual, dismissable) + `t()` for 5 hardcoded strings
- `src/lib/__tests__/trainingLoad.golden.test.js` — 12 golden test assertions
- `src/contexts/LangCtx.jsx` — 16 new EN+TR keys

**Test count**: 2740 (was 2728 before golden tests)

**Depends on**: v11.0.3, migrations 064+065

## [v11.0.3] — 2026-04-23

### FIX: Recovery sleep quality field not persisted; MorningCheckIn semantic mismatch; debug console.log

**Bug 1 — recovery.sleep (1-5) never in DB**
Sleep quality slider was dropped by `recEntryToRow` (same root cause as the energy bug fixed
in v11.0.2). Calendar showed "Sleep undefined/5", WellnessSparkline plotted null for every
sleep point, pdfReport weekly wellness table showed "—" for all sleep cells even with data.

**Bug 2 — MorningCheckIn semantic mismatch**
`MorningCheckIn` saved `wellness.energy` into the `mood` column and dropped `wellness.sleep`
entirely. With the `sleep` and `energy` DB columns now available, the entry is saved correctly.
`mood` defaults to 3 (neutral) since the quick check-in form doesn't ask about mood separately.

**Bug 3 — stray console.log in LoadHeatmapCard**
Debug `console.log('heatmap day clicked: ...')` in dead-code fallback path removed.

**Other**
- `package.json` version bumped from 8.1.0 to 11.0.3 (was severely out of sync)

**Changes**:
- `supabase/migrations/20260465_recovery_sleep_quality_column.sql` — `ADD COLUMN sleep SMALLINT CHECK(1-5)`; applied to production
- `src/hooks/useSupabaseData.js` — `recRowToEntry` + `recEntryToRow` now include `sleep`
- `src/lib/dataMigration.js` — guest→auth migration now writes `sleep` and `energy`
- `src/components/MorningCheckIn.jsx` — saves `sleep: wellness.sleep, energy: wellness.energy, mood: 3`
- `src/components/dashboard/LoadHeatmapCard.jsx` — removed stray console.log
- `package.json` — version 8.1.0 → 11.0.3

**Depends on**: migrations 064 (energy), 065 (sleep quality)

---

## [v11.0.2] — 2026-04-23

### FIX: Recovery energy field not persisted to DB (V2 fatigue alert permanently silent)

**Root cause**: `recovery` table had no `energy` column — the `energy` slider (1–5) from the
wellness check-in form was dropped by `recEntryToRow`. After DB hydration, `e.energy` was
`undefined` on all entries, causing V2's `getFatigueAccumulation` to always use fallback value
3 (≥ 2.5 threshold) → fatigue alert never fired for any user with synced history.

**Changes**:
- `supabase/migrations/20260464_recovery_energy_column.sql` — `ALTER TABLE recovery ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS energy SMALLINT CHECK (energy BETWEEN 1 AND 5)`; applied to production
- `src/hooks/useSupabaseData.js` — `recRowToEntry` now maps `row.energy`; `recEntryToRow` now writes `energy` column

**Depends on**: migration 001 (recovery table), migration 064 (energy column), V2 in Recovery.jsx (v11.0.0)

---

## [v11.0.1] — 2026-04-23

### HOTFIX: Google OAuth 500 — inject_tier_jwt_claim missing SET search_path

Root cause: `supabase_auth_admin` runs JWT hooks with `search_path = auth, pg_catalog` only.
`inject_tier_jwt_claim` had no `SET search_path`, so `SELECT subscription_tier FROM profiles`
threw "relation does not exist" → Supabase returned 500 to every sign-in attempt.

Fix: `SET search_path = public` added to function + `public.profiles` explicit table reference.
Outer `EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN RETURN event` safety net added as belt-and-suspenders.
Applied directly via `db query` (migration history diverged — `db push` blocked).
Verified: `proconfig = ["search_path=public"]` confirmed in production `pg_proc`.

DEPENDS ON: 20260416_fix_jwt_hook.sql (null-safety), 20260412_subscription.sql (subscription_tier column)

## [v11.0.0] — 2026-04-23

### V1–V5 — ruleInsights athlete-side: load spike, fatigue, rest, monotony, readiness label

All 5 items from `ruleInsights.js` — previously used only in the coach's `AthleteRow`. First-time exposure on the athlete side. `ruleInsights.js` extended with `.tr` and `.actionTr` fields on all returns.

- **V1 — TodayView: `getLoadTrendAlert` load spike bar**: When >10% week-on-week TSS increase in `weekLoad.dailyTSS`, shows amber alert bar below K3 strip with bilingual message + action.
- **V2 — Recovery: `getFatigueAccumulation` energy warning**: Maps last 3 recovery entries' `energy` (1–5) into `getFatigueAccumulation`. When avg < 2.5, shows red warning in the readiness card.
- **V3 — TodayView: `getMissedRestWarning` rest overdue bar**: Uses existing `consecutiveDays`. When ≥6, shows red "REST DAY OVERDUE" alert bar below K3.
- **V4 — TodayView K3: `getMonotonyWarning` action note**: When Foster 2001 monotony > 2.0, appends bilingual action text inside K3 below `M X.X`.
- **V5 — Recovery: `getReadinessLabel` coaching message**: ACWR + 7-day wellness avg composite, colour-coded level badge + message in readiness card (gated: ≥5 entries, ACWR available).

**Tests:** 2728 (unchanged). Build: clean.
**Semver:** v11.0.0

## [v10.9.0] — 2026-04-23

### U1–U5 — NextAction metrics strip, fitness AVG TSS, monotony status badge, digest PMC strip, EF date range

- **U1 — NextActionCard: `action.metrics` dim strip**: Every `computeNextAction` rule returns `metrics: {ctl, atl, tsb, acwr}` but these were never rendered. Added a `CTL · ATL · TSB · ACWR` dim strip below the citation, styled `#2a2a2a` to avoid visual noise.
- **U2 — TodayView L1 fitness strip: `avgWeeklyTSS`**: `predictFitness` returns `avgWeeklyTSS` but it was not shown in TodayView's L1 compact forecast (Dashboard.jsx does show it). Added `AVG {N} TSS/WK` (TR: `ORT {N} TSS/HFT`) inline with the CTL NOW → 4W → 8W row.
- **U3 — Dashboard monotony card: `weekLoadDetail.status` badge**: `computeMonotony` returns `status` ('low'/'moderate'/'high') but Dashboard only used `weekTSS` and `dailyTSS` from that result. Added a colour-coded status badge (`VARIED`/`MODERATE`/`HIGH`) below the daily TSS bars.
- **U4 — TodayView morning brief: `digest.ctl/tsb/acwr`**: `generateDailyDigest` returns `ctl`, `tsb`, `acwr` alongside the prose text but only the prose was rendered. Added a dim PMC sub-row (`CTL {n} · TSB ±{n} · ACWR {n}`) inside the morning brief card.
- **U5 — EFTrendCard: `result.dates` range label**: `efTrend.dates` (array of date strings for each EF data point) was returned but never used. Added a `MM-DD → MM-DD` date range line below the sparkline using `dates[0].slice(5)` / `dates[last].slice(5)`.

**Tests:** 2728 (unchanged — 1 pre-existing nextAction failure). Build: clean.

### T1–T5 — Recovery corr threshold detail, WeekStory stats strip, HRV daysWithData+dropPct, Profile tips TR, patterns sampleSize

- **T1 — InsightsPanel: `recovCorr.highLoadThreshold + avgRecAfterHard/Easy` detail**: Recovery correlation insight row had `detail: null`. Now shows `≥{threshold} TSS = hard · after hard: {X} · after easy: {Y}` when open.
- **T2 — WeekStoryCard: `n + totalMin + totalTSS + avgRPE` stat strip**: `generateWeeklyNarrative` returns these 4 fields separately but only the prose text was rendered. Added a dim stats strip above the narrative.
- **T3 — TodayView HRV strip: `daysWithData + dropPct`**: These two fields were returned by `computeHRVTrend` but never shown. Now appended to the secondary info row: `5d · ↓3.2%`.
- **T4 — Profile.jsx DATA QUALITY tips TR**: Tips rendered `{tip.en}` hardcoded for all languages. Fixed to `{lang === 'tr' ? tip.tr : tip.en}` via `localStorage.getItem('sporeus-lang')`.
- **T5 — Recovery.jsx YOUR PATTERNS: `sampleSize` shown**: `findRecoveryPatterns.sampleSize` was never shown in the standalone Recovery tab pattern card. Now displayed as a dim `{N} pairs` badge in the card header.

**Tests:** 2728 (unchanged — 1 pre-existing nextAction failure). Build: clean.

## [v10.7.0] — 2026-04-23

### S1–S5 — CTL/ATL in form tile, HRV strip with interpretation, EF mean, sub-threshold session counts, zone model tip TR fix

- **S1 — PerformanceMetrics: CTL·ATL sub-row in Form tile**: `getFormScore.ctl` and `.atl` were returned but only TSB was shown. Added `CTL {ctl} · ATL {atl}` dim sub-row below the TSB zone advice.
- **S2 — TodayView HRV strip: latestHRV + interpretation**: `computeHRVTrend.latestHRV` (today's value in ms) and `.interpretation` (bilingual) were computed but not surfaced. HRV strip now shows `{latestHRV}ms / {baseline}ms` and renders bilingual interpretation text below the bars.
- **S3 — EFTrendCard: mean EF in stats row**: `efTrend.mean` was returned but not shown. Added `{mean.toFixed(3)} mean/ort` to the stats row alongside latest, CV%, and n.
- **S4 — Dashboard sub-threshold bars: sessionsIncluded annotation**: `subThresholdTrend.sessionsIncluded` (per-week session count) was returned but never rendered. Now shows as a tiny number below each bar.
- **S5 — ZoneDistributorCard: zone model tip TR bug fix**: Both branches of `lang === 'tr' ? meta.tip : meta.tip` incorrectly rendered the English tip. Added `tipTr` to all 6 MODEL_META entries in `zoneDistrib.js` and fixed the render to `meta.tipTr` for TR users.

### R1–R5 — Daniels paces, injury zone chips, week template table, SESSION ANALYSIS TR, recovery_time TR

- **R1 — RaceReadiness: Daniels training paces table**: `predictRacePerformance.trainingPaces` (easy/marathon/threshold/interval/rep) was computed but never shown. Now renders as a pace table when prediction is reliable.
- **R2 — ProactiveInjuryAlert: vulnerable zones + protective factors**: `mineInjuryPatterns.vulnerableZones` (zone chips) and `protectiveFactors` (strength training correlation) were returned but never rendered.
- **R3 — YourPatternsCard: optimal week day schedule**: `findOptimalWeekStructure.bestPattern` (array of day/type/duration) was returned but only prose summary shown. Now renders as a mini day-by-day table when open and reliable.
- **R4 — TrainingLog SESSION ANALYSIS TR**: SEANS ANALİZİ / KARŞILAŞTIRMA / ZON TAHMİNİ / TOPARLANMA / NOTLAR labels + `zone_estimate` lookup map for Turkish users.
- **R5 — `analyseSession.recovery_time` TR**: finite set of "Allow Xh…" strings now localized in TrainingLog SESSION ANALYSIS and QuickAddModal confirmation screen.

- **Q1 — InsightsPanel load trend numeric row**: `analyzeLoadTrend.tss1/.tss2/.ctl/.atl` were returned but not rendered. When "MORE" is open, shows `W1: {tss1} TSS · W2: {tss2} TSS · CTL: {ctl} · ATL: {atl}` as a dim sub-row under the load trend advice.
- **Q2 — TodayView time-of-day advice TR localization**: `getTimeOfDayAdvice()` returns English-only strings. Added a TR lookup table in TodayView; TR users now see localized time advice in the Morning Brief.
- **Q3 — Injury risk numeric score in Recovery**: `predictInjuryRisk.score` (0–100) was computed but never shown. Added as a large numeric badge next to the RISK level label.
- **Q4 — InsightsPanel zone balance percentages**: `analyzeZoneBalance.z1z2Pct/.z3Pct/.z4z5Pct` were returned but not rendered. When "MORE" open, shows `Z1/Z2: X% · Z3: Y% · Z4/Z5: Z%` as numeric sub-row.
- **Q5 — InsightsPanel fitness TSB + 8-week projection**: `predictFitness.tsb` and `.in8w` were computed but not shown. When "MORE" open, shows `TSB: ±N · 4w: N CTL · 8w: N CTL` sub-row.

- **P1 — Raw metrics strip in TrainingLog expanded panel**: avgPower / avgHR / avgCadence / distanceM shown as colored badges when present (FIT/Strava imports). Gate: at least one field > 0.
- **P2 — 28d wellness baseline stat in TodayView Card 2**: `wellnessBaseline.mean ± sd` shown below the score always when baseline exists, not just in z-score warning. Gate: `wellnessBaseline && todayRec`.
- **P3 — Extended Recovery history table**: HRV (ms), resting HR (bpm), bedtime columns added conditionally for advanced athletes who log them. Table gets `overflowX: auto` wrapper. Gate: `isAdvanced && any entry has data`.
- **P4 — ACWR ratio tile in TodayView Card 3 Quick Stats**: `acwrRatio` was computed but only used in share canvas. Now shown as a 4th tile with color coding (green 0.8–1.3, amber <0.8, red >1.3). Gate: `log.length >= 7`.
- **P5 — Race date nudge in TodayView**: when no `profile.raceDate` set and `log.length >= 10`, shows a compact prompt with Profile shortcut button to unlock L2 race countdown + taper guidance.

### Auth bug fix — display_name overwrite on every Google sign-in

- **`useAuth.js`**: Removed `display_name` from `upsertProfile` upsert payload. The `handle_new_user` DB trigger already sets display_name from Google metadata on first sign-in; including it in the upsert was silently overwriting any user-customized name on every subsequent login.
- **`supabase/config.toml`**: Added `[auth.external.google]` section so Google OAuth works in local Supabase dev (requires `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars). Production remains configured via Supabase Dashboard.

### O1–O5 — UX completeness: session grades, source tags, protocol rationale, recap visual, readiness sparkline

Five enhancements closing UX gaps where computed data had no display surface.

- **O1 — Session grade badge in `TrainingLog.jsx`**: expanded session detail panel shows A–D grade, score/100, and bilingual feedback from `scoreSession()`. Gate: entry in expanded state.
- **O2 — suggestion.source badge in `TodayView.jsx`**: tiny monospace badge above smart suggestion action text showing why the suggestion was triggered (e.g. ACWR_HIGH, HRV_SUPPRESSED). Gate: `suggestion.source` truthy.
- **O3 — Protocol `when_to_use` rationale in `TodayView.jsx`**: italic one-liner below each recovery protocol name from `p.when_to_use`. No gate — always shown when protocol renders.
- **O4 — Weekly recap visual upgrade in `TodayView.jsx`**: plain text strip replaced with card — trend arrow + colored TSS total vs 4-week avg, session count %, CTL delta, dominant type, avg RPE. Dismissable with week-keyed localStorage flag.
- **O5 — 7-day readiness sparkline in `TodayView.jsx`** Card 2: SVG polyline of last 7 recovery scores with a 50-point dashed baseline. Color-coded by today's score level. Gate: `recovery.length >= 3 && todayRec`.

### N1–N5 — Stored data surfaced: mood/stress, lactate, VDOT paces, cadence, metrics row

Five enhancements displaying data that was collected but never visualised.

- **N1 — Mood + stress 7-day sparklines in `Recovery.jsx`**: dual SVG polyline (blue = mood, red = stress) below sleep trend. Shows 7-day averages. Alert when avgStress > 3.5 AND avgMood < 3. Gate: `entries.length >= 3`.
- **N2 — Lactate trend card in `Recovery.jsx`** (advanced/elite only): sparkline of last 10 lactate readings with a 2.0 mmol/L baseline reference line. Latest value shown; red border + "elevated" warning when latest > 2.0. Gate: `isAdvanced && ≥2 readings`.
- **N3 — Training pace reference in `TodayView.jsx`**: compact 3-badge strip (EASY / THRESH / INT in min:sec/km) from `getTrainingPaces(profile.vo2max)` (Daniels VDOT table). Gate: `profile.vo2max > 0`. First UI surfacing of the vdot.js paces output.
- **N4 — Cadence trend strip in `Dashboard.jsx`**: SVG sparkline of last 24 sessions with `avgCadence > 0`. Shows avg rpm + optimal range note (run 170–180, cycle 85–95). Gate: `≥5 cadence entries` in filtered log. Positioned before WEEKLY VOLUME card.
- **N5 — Key profile metrics row in `Dashboard.jsx` header**: FTP / MAX HR / VO₂max / WEIGHT / LT2 badges shown after sport/level/coach row in both beginner and advanced views. Gate: `≥2 metrics set`.

### M1–M5 — Unused function surfacing + data field display

Five enhancements: one unused function wired, four stored-data fields surfaced.

- **M1 — `isHRVSuppressed` alert in `TodayView.jsx`**: Red alert strip ("HRV suppressed — easy session only. Plews 2013") shown above NextActionCard when `isHRVSuppressed(recovery)` is true (HRV CV ≥ 10% AND latest below mean). Gated `recovery.length >= 3`. Wires the only remaining unused hrv.js export.
- **M2 — Latest RESTQ result badge in `TodayView.jsx`**: Shows most recent RESTQ balance score and interpretation label (green/blue/amber/red) between RESTQ nudge card and Smart Suggestion. Gated: history exists AND `!restqDue` (complements the nudge, not duplicates it).
- **M3 — Source badge in `TrainingLog.jsx` session rows**: `STR` (orange, Strava) or `FIT` (blue) label before notes text when `entry.source === 'strava'` or `'fit'`. Manual entries show no badge (default assumption).
- **M4 — Recent session notes widget in `Dashboard.jsx`**: Compact card "SESSION NOTES" showing last 3 entries with non-empty notes (date · type · TSS + note text). Inserted after RecentSessionsCard. Gate: at least 1 entry with notes in filtered log.
- **M5 — Yesterday's session note in `TodayView.jsx` Morning Brief**: If `yesterdayEntry.notes` exists, shows it as an italicised quote below the "Yesterday: X TSS…" line with a left border accent.

Five genuine feature additions beyond unused-function surfacing.

- **L1 — `predictFitness` compact forecast strip in `TodayView.jsx`**: CTL now/4w/8w trajectory bar (↑↓→) with label text from `predictFitness(log)`. Gated `log.length >= 14`. Positioned between K3 weekLoad strip and consecutive rest warning.
- **L2 — Race countdown card in `TodayView.jsx`**: Days-to-race badge from `profile.raceDate`. Shows phase label (BUILD / TAPER / RACE WEEK / RACE DAY), date, and color coding (blue/amber/orange). Gated on future date ≤ 120 days. Inserted before K3 weekLoad.
- **L3 — `predictFitness` detailed 4w/8w projection in `Dashboard.jsx`**: Full projection row (CTL now → 4W → 8W, avg TSS/wk, trajectory arrow + label) after J2/J3 CTL/TSB interpretation block. Gated `lc.showCTL && log.length >= 14`.
- **L4 — Recovery baseline weekly comparison in `Recovery.jsx`**: THIS WEEK avg vs 4W rolling avg score badge in readiness card. Green ≥ 4W avg, amber within 10%, red >10% below. Gated `week1.length >= 2 && week4.length >= 5`.
- **L5 — Goal-context line in `TodayView.jsx` Morning Brief**: If `profile.goal` is set, shows goal string + CTL phase label (strong base / building / base phase) in Morning Brief card. Gated `profile.goal && todayCtl > 0`.

### K1–K5 — Final unused function sweep (durabilityScore, trainingLoad, interpretations)

Five enhancements exhausting the remaining unused science library functions.

- **K1 — `interpretDecoupling` in TrainingLog expanded rows** (`TrainingLog.jsx`): replaces the static `"<5% coupled · 5–10% mild · >10% significant — Friel 2009"` line with the full bilingual interpretation from `interpretDecoupling(pct)` (Friel 2009). Fires only when `entry.decouplingPct` is set (FIT imports with HR streams).
- **K2 — `classifyTSB` in `PerformanceMetrics.jsx`** (`dashboard/PerformanceMetrics.jsx`): TSB tile now shows Coggan zone name (Fresh / Peak Form, Neutral, Optimal Training Stress, Overreaching Risk) and bilingual advice text from `classifyTSB(form.tsb)`. Border color updated to match zone color.
- **K3 — `computeMonotony.dailyTSS` 7-day bar chart in `TodayView.jsx`**: compact 7-day TSS mini bar strip (Mon–Sun) using `computeMonotony(log).dailyTSS`. Today highlighted in orange; zero-TSS days in dark. Monotony value and week total shown right of bars. Color-coded by monotony status (Foster 1998: low/moderate/high).
- **K4 — `computeMonotony.dailyTSS` bars in Dashboard monotony card**: 7-bar daily TSS sparkline added below the monotony interpretation text in the existing monotony index card. Color follows monoRed alert state.
- **K5 — `classifyTSB` zone badge in `Recovery.jsx`** readiness section: TSB zone badge (zone name + Coggan advice, `log.length >= 7` gate) inserted below the sleep warning in the readiness score card, providing training-load context alongside the wellness-based readiness score.

**Tests:** 2728 (unchanged) — all pass. Build: clean.
**Semver:** v9.9.0

DEPENDS ON: v9.8.0 (J-series, interpretations.js, subThresholdTime.js)

---

## [v9.8.0] — 2026-04-21

### J1–J5 — Science interpretation library surfaced (interpretations.js + subThresholdTime.js)

Five enhancements wiring the previously unused science interpretation functions into existing UI cards.

- **J1 — `interpretACWR` in ACWRCard** (`dashboard/ACWRCard.jsx`): bilingual science interpretation (Gabbett 2016 / Hulin 2016) appended below the 8-week ACWR chart. Explains current ratio meaning and action guidance with citation.
- **J2 — `interpretCTL` in Dashboard**: CTL fitness-phase interpretation (Banister/Coggan) shown below ReadinessCard, gated `log.length >= 14`. Includes 4-week trend using `daily[−28].ctl`.
- **J3 — `interpretTSB` in Dashboard**: TSB zone interpretation (Coggan zones) shown alongside CTL interpretation, same gate.
- **J4 — `interpretMonotony` in Dashboard monotony section**: bilingual interpretation text (Foster 1998) added beneath the monotony index number in the zone distribution card.
- **J5 — `subThresholdTrend` 8-week bar chart in Dashboard** (`src/lib/science/subThresholdTime.js`, Seiler 2010): compact 8-bar sparkline of weekly Z1+Z2 minutes. Gated on `profile.maxhr` (uses 90% of max HR as threshold) or `profile.ftp` (uses FTP as power threshold). Only renders when at least one non-null week exists.

**Tests:** 2728 (unchanged) — all pass. Build: clean.
**Semver:** v9.8.0

DEPENDS ON: v9.7.0 (I-series wiring)

---

## [v9.7.0] — 2026-04-21

### I1–I5 — Intelligence surfacing II: 5 more enhancements using existing pure functions

Five additional enhancements wiring already-tested pure functions into new UI locations.

- **I1 — analyseSession in QuickAddModal post-save** (`QuickAddModal.jsx`): post-save confirmation now calls `analyseSession(entry, log.slice(-28))` and displays comparison (above/below type average) + recovery_time estimate. Close delay extended 2.2s → 3.5s. `useData()` added for log access. Test mock updated.
- **I2 — findRecoveryPatterns card in Recovery.jsx**: data-driven patterns card (gated: `!patterns.needsMore` — requires 7+ recovery entries and 6+ session–recovery pairs). Shows best/worst training day badges, optimal readiness range, optimal sleep range, and up to 2 red flags.
- **I3 — EFTrendCard wired to Dashboard** (`Dashboard.jsx`): `EFTrendCard` (Coggan 2003, already in `src/components/science/` but unmounted) lazy-loaded after InsightsPanel. Transforms log to EF shape `{date, avgHR, np, avgPower, avgPaceMPerMin, sport}`. Gracefully shows "Need ≥8 sessions in 30d" for users without HR/power data.
- **I4 — analyzeRecoveryCorrelation card in Recovery.jsx**: load-recovery effect card (gated: `corr.correlation !== null` — requires 3+ session–recovery pairs). Shows avgRecAfterHard / avgRecAfterEasy scores + insight text.
- **I5 — findSeasonalPatterns badge in TodayView** (`TodayView.jsx`): compact PEAK MONTH / OFF-PEAK MONTH badge (gated: 3+ months of data, current month is strong or weak). Positioned between NextActionCard and Morning Brief.

**Tests:** 2728 (unchanged) — all pass. Build: clean.
**Semver:** v9.7.0

DEPENDS ON: v9.6.0 (H-series, nextAction chain, MorningCheckIn)

---

## [v9.6.0] — 2026-04-21

### H1–H5 — Intelligence surfacing: 5 enhancements using existing pure functions

Five targeted enhancements that surface already-tested pure analysis functions into new UI locations.

- **H1 — Sleep tracking in MorningCheckIn** (`MorningCheckIn.jsx`): added sleep hours slider (4–10h, step 0.5h) to 30-second check-in. `sleepHrs` now saved to recovery store as string (matches Recovery.jsx format).
- **H1 — `sleep_debt` rule in nextAction.js**: Rule 5 — fires when avg sleepHrs < 7h over last 7 days with ≥3 readings. Color: amber. Citation: Mah 2011 (SLEEP — sleep extension in athletes).
- **H2 — `injury_risk_high` rule in nextAction.js**: Rule 3 — calls `predictInjuryRisk(log, recovery)` (existing 5-factor model: ACWR, monotony, consecutive hard days, readiness, HRV); fires when level === 'HIGH'. Color: red. Citation: Hulin 2016 (Br J Sports Med). Priority chain fully renumbered: 0–11.
- **H3 — Race time predictions in RaceReadiness tab** (`RaceReadiness.jsx`): added `predictRacePerformance` section below 10-factor breakdown — shows 5K/10K/HM/Marathon predicted times (range: best–worst), method label, VDOT. Only renders when `reliable === true`.
- **H4 — HRV 7-day trend strip in TodayView** (`TodayView.jsx`): inline bar chart (7 bars, last 7 calendar days) with trend badge and baseline ms. Color-coded by `computeHRVTrend` result. Visible when ≥3 HRV readings in 7 days.
- **H5 — Data quality card in Profile tab** (`Profile.jsx`): collapsible card using `assessDataQuality` (previously unused anywhere). Shows grade A–F, 0–100 score, 6-factor badges (LOGGING/RPE/ZONES/RECOVERY/TESTS/PROFILE), top-3 actionable tips.
- **+8 tests** in `nextAction.test.js` (4 for `injury_risk_high`, 4 for `sleep_debt`)

DEPENDS ON: v9.5.0 (MorningCheckIn, nextAction rules, computeHRVTrend, predictInjuryRisk)

---

## [v9.5.0] — 2026-04-21

### G5 — Morning Readiness & HRV Integration (E17)

30-second daily check-in modal with Plews 2013 HRV trend analysis. Feeds into the G3 next-action direction card.

- **`src/lib/hrv.js`**: added `computeHRVTrend(entries)` — 7-day rolling CV (Plews 2013), thresholds: stable <7%, warning 7–10%, unstable ≥10%; and `isHRVSuppressed(entries)` — convenience predicate. Bilingual interpretation strings.
- **`src/lib/nextAction.js`**: Rule 3 `hrv_drift` inserted (priority 3, between `wellness_poor` and `acwr_high`) — fires when HRV CV ≥10% + latest >5% below baseline → recommends easy session (Plews 2013 citation)
- **`src/components/MorningCheckIn.jsx`**: modal with `useFocusTrap`, overlay/Escape dismiss, optional HRV RMSSD input (ms), three 1–5 wellness sliders (sleep/energy/soreness), saves to `recovery` store `{date, score, sleepHrs:null, soreness, stress:3, mood, hrv}`, post-save shows HRV trend card with color + bilingual interpretation
- **`src/components/TodayView.jsx`**: "Morning Readiness Check-In" button added above NextActionCard, visible when no recovery entry exists for today; `MorningCheckIn` lazy-loaded via `Suspense`
- **15 tests** in `src/lib/__tests__/hrv.test.js` (insufficient_data, stable, warning, unstable, dropPct, window filtering, null HRV, output shape, isHRVSuppressed)

DEPENDS ON: v9.4.0 (DataContext setRecovery, G3 nextAction.js hrv_drift rule)

---

## [v9.4.0] — 2026-04-21

### G4 — E14 Race Readiness Calculator

- **`RaceReadiness.jsx`**: new RACE READY tab — 0–100 readiness score, A+/A/B/C/D/F grade, traffic-light indicator (green ≥75, amber 55–74, red <55), 10-factor breakdown with progress bars (FITNESS, FRESHNESS, TAPER, CONSISTENCY, RECOVERY, SLEEP, INJURY, COMPLIANCE, ZONE BALANCE, LONG SESSION), top-3 improvement areas, race date + goal inputs with save-to-profile, citation footer (Banister 1991, Coggan 2003, Morton 1991, Mujika 2003)
- Uses existing `computeRaceReadiness()` from `intelligence.js` — no new computation added
- **LangCtx**: `t_race` label (EN: 'RACE READY', TR: 'YARIŞ HAZIRLIĞI'); `race` tab added to TABS
- **App.jsx**: lazy import + `tab === 'race'` render
- **15 tests** in `raceReadiness.test.js` (acceptance gate, boundary conditions, output shape, injury suppression)

DEPENDS ON: v9.3.0 (DataContext via useData, G3 rules card)

---

## [v9.3.0] — 2026-04-21

### G3 — Rules-based next-action card

First new user-visible feature since E12. Above-the-fold card on TodayView that tells the user what to do next — replacing passive data display with active guidance.

- **`src/lib/nextAction.js`** (pure): 9 priority-ordered rules — `no_sessions` (orientation), `acwr_spike` (Gabbett 2016 — ACWR > 1.5 → mandatory rest), `wellness_poor` (Meeusen 2013 — low wellbeing), `acwr_high` (ACWR 1.3–1.5 → caution), `tsb_deep` (Banister 1991 — TSB < −20 → rest), `race_taper` (Mujika 2003 — race ≤14d), `tsb_high` (Coggan 2003 — quality window), `tsb_low` (fatigue → easy), `acwr_low` (below base → build), `default` (Seiler 2010 — moderate session). Every rule bilingual (EN/TR) + citation.
- **`src/components/NextActionCard.jsx`**: color-coded card (red/amber/green/blue/muted), dismiss button suppresses rule for 24h via `sporeus-nac-dismissed-{ruleId}` localStorage key
- **`TodayView.jsx`**: `<NextActionCard />` renders above Morning Brief
- **29 tests** in `nextAction.test.js` (all 9 rules, output shape, dismissal)

DEPENDS ON: v9.2.8 (DataContext with TQ hooks)

---

## [v9.2.8] — 2026-04-21

### G2 — TanStack Query v5 for training log, profile, and session comments

- **`@tanstack/react-query` v5.99.2** added (13 KB gzip); `ReactQueryDevtools` lazy-loaded in dev only
- **`useTrainingLogQuery`**: replaces `useTrainingLog` in DataContext; `useQuery` with `initialData` from localStorage (zero flash), staleTime 30s, `refetchOnWindowFocus`, optimistic `setLog()` with TQ cache + localStorage update + Supabase background sync + `invalidateQueries`
- **`useProfileQuery`**: replaces `useProfileSync` in DataContext; same pattern; staleTime 60s; preserves new-user local→remote migration logic
- **`useSessionComments`**: TQ cache seeded after `fetchComments`; `invalidateQueries` after post/edit/delete mutations
- **`DataContext.jsx`**: imports new TQ hooks; recovery/injuries/testResults/raceResults unchanged
- **`App.jsx`**: `QueryClientProvider` wraps `DataProvider`; `TQDevtools` lazy via `import.meta.env.DEV`
- 12 new tests (query key, offline data, setLog/setProfile signatures); `useSessionComments.test.js` TQ mock added
- `docs/ops/tanstack_query_pattern.md`: pattern guide for new flows

DEPENDS ON: v9.2.7 (G1 onboarding, DataContext shape)

---

## [v9.2.7] — 2026-04-21

### G1 — Smart QuickAdd defaults, Valibot validation, first-session flow

- **QuickAddModal**: sport-based default session type (Running→Easy Run, Cycling→Easy Ride, Swimming→Easy Swim); duration defaults to 45 min; RPE effort labels (5 plain-language levels); Valibot `SessionSchema` validates before submit; post-save confirmation phase (2.2s checkmark + Training Load summary); "Training Load (TSS)" label replaces "Est. TSS"; Foster 2001 sRPE citation shown; `isFirst` prop triggers 🏆 first-step celebration
- **App.jsx**: passes `profile` and `isFirst={log.length === 0}` to QuickAddModal
- **useAppState.js**: `handleAddSession` detects first entry and auto-navigates to Today tab after 2.4s
- **18 new tests** in `QuickAddModal.test.jsx` (5 describe blocks: defaults, TSS label, RPE labels, validation, submission/close)
- `docs/ops/new_user_flow.md`: new-user journey documented

DEPENDS ON: v9.2.6 (AuthGate, profile shape)

---

## [v9.2.6] — 2026-04-21

### F1 — Auth flow audit & Google sign-in hardening

**Three production issues fixed:**
- **Security**: Removed stale `https://lhr-present.github.io/sporeus-athlete/` from Supabase allowed redirect URLs. If that GitHub Pages URL was ever compromised, it could have received real auth tokens. Fixed via Supabase Management API.
- **UX**: Removed `prompt:'consent'` + `access_type:'offline'` from Google OAuth params. These forced the Google consent screen on every login for returning users. Replaced with `prompt:'select_account'` (shows account picker, no forced consent).
- **Dev**: Fixed dev redirect URL in allowlist — was `/sporeus-athlete/` (wrong path for `base:'/'`), now `http://localhost:5173/`.
- 2 new assertions in `AuthGate.test.jsx` verifying OAuth params and redirect URL.
- `docs/ops/auth_flow_audit.md` committed with full findings.

DEPENDS ON: v9.2.5 (AuthGate, supabase.js implicit flow)

---

## [v9.2.5] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- P4 hook enforcement: `commit-msg` hook replaces broken `pre-commit` approach. `pre-commit` was reading stale `COMMIT_EDITMSG` (previous commit's message); `commit-msg` receives `$1` by git contract. Hook was non-functional between 10b271e–e36687c.
- Hook versioned in `.githooks/commit-msg` (tracked). `core.hooksPath` set in repo config. `postinstall` in `package.json` auto-wires new clones.

DEPENDS ON: v9.2.4 (P4 CHANGELOG + pre-commit hook — now superseded by this fix)

## [v9.2.4] — 2026-04-21

**Infrastructure hardening (P1 + P3 + P4). No feature additions.**

- **P1 route-smoke suite** (`tests/e2e/route-smoke.spec.ts`): 27 Playwright tests covering all 22 BOOK_MODE chapter routes + EMBED/SCIENCE/PRIVACY modes. No auth required. Catches white-screen and auth-gate regressions before tag.
- **P3 pre-deploy gate** (`deploy.yml`): `deploy` job now requires `route-smoke` job to pass. Uses `playwright.route-smoke.config.js` + stub Supabase env — no production secrets needed.
- **CHANGELOG.md backfill**: v9.x history added (this block + below).
- **Session log corrections**: debt session item 5 accurately scoped to RLS-isolation-only; behavioral scenarios A–D + F–G flagged as deferred.
- Caveat verification: `supabase_functions.hooks` confirms `comment-notification` is a managed webhook (visible in Dashboard), not a shadow pg_net trigger.

DEPENDS ON: v9.2.3, v9.2.2

---

## [v9.2.3] — 2026-04-21 (HOTFIX — E16 regression)

**Impact window:** ~6 days (E16 shipped ~2026-04-15, caught 2026-04-21 in debt session)
**Symptom:** All 22 book QR codes hit login screen. Silent — Sentry was dark, 2629 tests green.

- `App.jsx`: moved `if (BOOK_MODE)` from line 522 (after `if (!user) return <AuthGate>`) to line 479 (before auth gate). Unauthenticated visitors now reach `ChapterLanding` correctly.
- `docs/ops/session_log.md`: item 1 evidence committed.

DEPENDS ON: App.jsx BOOK_MODE, ChapterLanding, E16 chapter routes

---

## [v9.2.2] — 2026-04-21 (HOTFIX — build break)

**Symptom:** Dev server and prod build would crash on first render of coach/science components. Silent — never deployed with this bug in the bundle.

- 6 components imported non-existent `useLanguage` hook from `LangCtx.jsx`: `ExpandedRow`, `TeamAnnouncement`, `SquadPatternSearch`, `EFTrendCard`, `MetricExplainer`, `DecouplingChart`. Fixed to `useContext(LangCtx)`.
- `docs/ops/realtime_runbook.md`: added `coach_athletes` schema (debt session item 3).
- `supabase/migrations/20260460_realtime_comments.sql` applied: `session_comments` + `session_views` tables, RLS, Realtime publication.
- `supabase/migrations/20260461_fix_sv_rls.sql`: fixed `sv: read own or linked` — athletes can now see coach presence records for their sessions (CoachPresenceBadge was silently broken since E11).
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` GitHub secret set; CSP `connect-src` updated for Sentry ingest; `.env.test` blanks DSN for test isolation.

DEPENDS ON: LangCtx, E11 realtime, E15 Sentry, E16 book routes

---

## [v9.2.1] — 2026-04-19
